<https://kpop.fandom.com/wiki/2NE1> a schema:Class ;
    rdfs:label "2NE1" ;
    dbo:abstract """ 2NE1 ( Korean : 투애니원 , IPA: [tʰu.ɛ.ni.wʌn] ) was a South Korean girl group composed of Bom , CL , Dara , and Minzy , formed by YG Entertainment in 2009. After appearing alongside boy band Big Bang in the song " Lollipop ", a promotional single for LG Electronics , the group rose to fame with the release of their two eponymous extended plays , 2NE1 (2009) and 2NE1 (2011), and two studio albums, To Anyone (2010) and Crush (2014). All peaked at the number one position on the Gaon Album Chart . They also scored nine number one hits on the Gaon Digital Chart , with " Try to Follow Me ", " Go Away ", " Lonely ", " I Am the Best ", "Ugly", " I Love You ", " Falling in Love ", "Missing You", and " Come Back Home ". The quartet simultaneously conducted a similarly successful career in Japan, releasing first a Japanese version of their second EP, Nolza (2011) and following up with the studio albums Collection (2012) and Crush (2014). Following a long-term hiatus, Minzy departed the group in April 2016, while the rest of the group disbanded later that November. Their final single "Good Bye" was released on January 21, 2017. At the peak of their career and prior to their split, 2NE1 was considered one of the most successful and popular girl groups in South Korea. Having sold 66.5 million records, they are one of the best selling girl groups of all time . Billboard magazine ranked 2NE1 as one of the best K-pop girl groups of the past decade while The New York Times named 2NE1's performance at the Prudential Center in New Jersey as one of the "Best Concerts of 2012". 2NE1 was first mentioned by South Korean press in late 2004. Both Spica 's Bohyung and Fiestar 's Linzy were trainees alongside the 2NE1 members. However, they were eliminated before debut. YG Entertainment formally announced in early 2009 that the group would consist of four members and debut sometime in May of that year. The company stated that the group had trained for four years, and that their debut album would contain songs produced by 1TYM 's leader Teddy Park . The group's name was initially announced as "21", however, due to the discovery of a singer with the same name, the group was quickly renamed "2NE1". The name, pronounced in Korean to approximate English as "To Anyone" or ( US ) "Twenty One", combines the phrases "21st century" and "New Evolution". 2NE1's first extended play 2NE1 (2009) was preceded by two singles. The first one, " Lollipop ", was recorded with label mate Big Bang and released on March 27, 2009 to promote the LG Cyon phone. Though a music video was filmed, "Lollipop" was not promoted due to its product advertisement affiliation, which caused issues with the network chart eligibility. The second single, " Fire ", written and produced by 1TYM 's Teddy Park , was released that May and contained elements of hip-hop and reggae . Its music video had two versions — a "space" version and a "street" version. Within the first 24 hours of release, the videos each received over one million views. Both the song "Fire" and the group became popular online search terms. The final single, " I Don't Care ", was released simultaneously alongside their first eponymous EP in July. Promotional activities quickly followed to demonstrate a softer, more feminine image of the group to contrast the edgier image previously portrayed in "Fire". "I Don't Care" became the most downloaded song of that month, later winning Song of the Year at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . Although group members recorded and released their own solo materials in August, they performed a reggae version of "I Don't Care" on Inkigayo in September. Due to the remix's popularity, it was released to digital outlets on September 3 as their next digital single. Buoyed by the success of their singles, sales of 2NE1 totaled 100,000 copies by the end of the year. 2NE1 later performed at the 6th Asia Song Festival , representing Korea alongside three other groups and later winning the Asian Newcomer's award. In 2010, 2NE1 unexpectedly released " Try to Follow Me " in February through various digital outlets without any prior announcement or promotion to support the Samsung 's Corby Folder. The song peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart. That summer, 2NE1 traveled to Los Angeles and London to record English songs for an American debut album with The Black Eyed Peas 's member and music producer will.i.am . The group recorded a total of 10 songs in their initial sessions. The quartet's first full-length album, To Anyone (2010), was released on September 9, and debuted at number 7 on the Billboard World Album Chart. Prior to the release of the album, it had already received 120,000 preorders. Containing a total of 12 tracks, four singles were released: the top five hits " Clap Your Hands ", " Can't Nobody ", " It Hurts (Slow) " and the chart-topping " Go Away ". A fifth song "Don't Stop the Music" was recorded as a "special gift for Thai fans" and was also used in conjunction with the group's Yamaha Fiore endorsement. At the 2010 Mnet Asian Music Awards , 2NE1 took home the most accolades: "Artist of the Year", "Best Music Video" for "Can't Nobody", "Best Female Group", and "Album of the Year" award. On January 19, 2011, " Can't Nobody (English Version)" was released on the Japanese digital retailer Recochoku as a ringtone and ringback tone . The following month, an accompanying music video was made available for download through iTunes Japan. Their Japanese debut single " Go Away " was released as a ringtone on March 9, and later used as the theme song for the Japanese television program Mezamashi TV . On March 16, the quartet's first Korean EP 2NE1 was made available in Japan; promotional activities were canceled due to the Tōhoku Earthquake and tsunami . 2NE1 debuted at #24 on the Oricon charts , selling 3,860 copies in its first week of release. Initial plans for their official Japanese debut on Music Station were postponed to later that year due to the earthquake, though the quartet did participate in the Naver "Pray for Japan" campaign alongside many other Korean celebrities to raise funds for earthquake victims. The group returned to South Korea with their second EP 2NE1 (2011), scoring three number one hits: " Lonely ", " I Am the Best ", which also won the "Song of the Year" award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards , and "Ugly" as well as the top three hit " Hate You ". The album itself was a major success, topping the Gaon Chart and selling over 108,000 copies. Following the end of promotions in August, 2NE1 held their first sold-out solo concert at the Olympic Hall in the Chamsil Olympic Park on August 26, 27 and 28 in Seoul, South Korea before flying back to Japan. Choosing to re-record their second EP 2NE1 (2011) in Japanese, the album was re-issued as Nolza and released that same year, peaking at number one on the Oricon charts and selling over 48,000 copies. Japanese-language editions of "I Am the Best", "Hate You", "Go Away", and "Lonely" were released as singles. They also commenced the 2NE1 First Japan Tour – Nolza on September 19 and 20 at the Yokohama Arena. That October, MTV Iggy held a global competition, in which 10 bands from all around the world competed in a voting competition for the title of "Best New Band". With their song "I Am the Best", 2NE1 was crowned winners of the title on November 10, 2011, making this their first US award. 2NE1 performed at Times Square in December to accept the honor. At the end of 2011, 2NE1 was also nominated for the Japan Record Award for "Best New Artist", losing to Japanese girl group Fairies . On March 28, 2012, 2NE1 released their first full-length Japanese album Collection along with their second Japanese single " Scream ". The album includes Japanese remakes of their Korean songs such as "Love Is Ouch", " Fire ", and " I Don't Care ", and a cover of Madonna 's 1984 hit song " Like A Virgin ". Multiple editions of the album were released to include a DVD containing the groups Japanese and Korean music videos, according to Oricon 's music website. The album peaked at #5 on the Oricon Daily Chart and went on to sell over 32,000 copies in Japan. Later that year, 2NE1 and label mate Big Bang were invited to perform for the first time at 2012's Springroove festival in Japan alongside some of the top American and Japanese hip hop artists. The previous year, 2NE1 and the subgroup GD & TOP were invited, but due to the Japan tsunami and earthquake tragedy, the festival was cancelled. 2NE1 also collaborated with Japanese hip-hop group M-Flo for the song "She's So (Outta Control)", which was featured on the artist's sixth studio album Square One . It was released as the leading track from the album, two weeks before the album's release on February 29. "She's So (Outta Control)" reached number 43 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart. 2NE1 subsequently concluded their Japanese promotions by performing at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Japan , which took place on June 23 at the Makuhari Messe . They also won the "Best New Artist Video" award for their song "I Am the Best". A non-album single " I Love You " was also released in their home country, topping the chart and becoming their sixth number one single. That December, 2NE1 and Big Bang made MTV Style's list of "Best Band Style of 2012". The two YG Entertainment groups are the only Asian artists to make the list of 10, which includes One Direction , The Wanted , Backstreet Boys , Spice Girls , Destiny's Child , Fun and No Doubt . On March 14, 2013, 2NE1 released the English-language single "Take the World On", which was a collaboration with American singer will.i.am . The song had previously been used in an Intel Ultrabook commercial On March 21, in an interview with Elle , CL confirmed that the group has not yet planned an album for the United States, but wanted to produce more songs in English. A second collaboration with will.i.am brought forth "Gettin' Dumb"; this time including his bandmate apl.de.ap . The song was featured on will.i.am's second album #willpower , which was released on April 23. 2NE1's next singles were not tied to any album, with the chart-topping " Falling in Love " and "Missing You", becoming their seventh and eighth number one singles. A third, " Do You Love Me ", was a top three hit. In 2014, the quartet appeared on an episode of The Bachelor in January and later, on the finale for America's Next Top Model where the latter show was filmed in South Korea. The following month, 2NE1 released their second studio album Crush (2014). Two singles were released simultaneously: " Come Back Home " and "Happy". "Come Back Home" peaked at number one on the Gaon Singles Chart, becoming their ninth number one hit. Their third single from the album, " Gotta Be You " was subsequently released on May 20 along with a music video. Crush sold 5,000 copies in 4 days in America, peaking at #61 on Billboard 200 and setting a new U.S record for "Highest Charting and Best Selling Kpop Album", beating other groups such as Girls' Generation and Big Bang. On June 26, they released the Japanese edition of Crush, which charted at #4 on the Oricon Daily Album Chart. The group's also held their fourth concert tour AON: All or Nothing , which included stops in China, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia. From March to October, they performed a total of twenty concerts across 16 cities, totaling 180,000 attendees. 2NE1's previous single, "I Am The Best", was released on December 11 in the U.S. under Capitol Records . On December 18, their song "Gotta Be You" was crowned "Song of the Year" by MTV Iggy. The group received worldwide recognition at the end of 2014. Crush was the only record by an Asian artist to make it to Fuse TV 's "40 Best Albums of 2014" and ranked first in Billboard magazine's list of "Best Kpop Album of 2014" as well as eleventh for its year-end World Album chart. Following the suspension of Bom's contract due to her 2014 drug scandal , other members began exploring independent ventures, sending the group effectively into hiatus. Dara re-established her acting career by starring in web dramas such as Dr.Ian and We Broke Up , as well as KBS's Missing You . Minzy opened the Millennium Dance Academy. CL embarked a solo career in the United States with the release of " Hello Bitches " from her upcoming EP Lifted . The group's only activity in 2015 was a surprise performance at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards in Hong Kong. After CL's performance of her solo singles "The Baddest Female" and "Hello Bitches", all members reunited to perform "Fire" and "I Am the Best". The performance is now the most-viewed MAMA performance by a girl-group. It was applauded and as a result, was listed as one of the best performances of 2015 by Fuse . Despite not having made a comeback, 2NE1 nonetheless was the 16th most reblogged K-pop group on Tumblr for 2015. Additionally, both 2NE1 and CL were given a nod by Spotify in their "Year in Music" Twitter Campaign for each achieving over one million listeners, and being played a "staggering" 165 years worth when combined. They also won China 's 2016 Korea First Brand Grand Prize award for "Top 10 Most Anticipated K-Stars of 2016". After a year of hiatus, YG Entertainment confirmed the departure of Minzy in April 2016, stating that the group will continue as a trio. Later that November, however, YG Entertainment announced the disbandment of the group. CL and Dara remained signed as solo artists, while Bom was released from her contract. A last single, "Goodbye", was released in January 2017 as a farewell to their fans, inspired by a letter CL initially wrote to Minzy. The song topped the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. In 2NE1's debut EP 2NE1 (2009), the group was noted to have a distinct, mixed style. While " Lollipop " was categorized as for pop , debut single " Fire " is predominately influenced by hip hop . " I Don't Care ", however, was intended as a song with a reggae feel. Their comeback album, To Anyone , was marked by a strong shift into electronic music. " Go Away ", the most successful promotional single from the album, is classified as dance . However, songs like " It Hurts (Slow) " are R&B , another style that also characterized their first EP. The three title tracks, " Clap Your Hands ", "Go Away", and " Can't Nobody " were noted for their lasting impressions. 2NE1 was known for a "unique and edgier style". During their debut single, the group was noted for being "hip-hop" and the female counterpart to Big Bang but changed this perception with "I Don't Care" into strong, feminine women. During the "It Hurts (Slow)" music video, the members were noted for their Gothic, black attire and strange hair and wigs. Zack Greenburg from the American business magazine Forbes described 2NE1 as a pop group characterized by bold, bright outfits and big, catchy hooks punctuated by rap verses and an "in-your-face swagger". He also considers the group to be "bigger than Psy ", singer of the worldwide hit single " Gangnam Style ". The quartet have used their image in a number of advertisements and promotional tie-ins. In 2009, they signed a modelling deal with Fila to a new commercial campaign. In early May 2013, the website "2NE1Loves.com" was launched along with mysterious videos of the members. The project was later revealed to be 2NE1 Loves Shinsegae , an endorsement for a department store and brand Chrome Hearts. Their songs have been used as well, with "Lollipop" for the LG Cyon phone, " Follow Me " for the Samsung 's Corby Folder, " Go Away " as the theme song for the Japanese television program Mezamashi TV , and "Don't Stop the Music" for their Yamaha Fiore endorsement. During the 2011 Tōhoku Earthquake and tsunami , 2NE1 lend their image to the Naver "Pray for Japan" campaign to help raise funds for victims. 2NE1 recorded R&B songs with styles that encompasses urban and dance-pop . They have credited the Spice Girls and TLC as girl group influences. Park Bom cited American singers, Beyoncé and Mariah Carey as her main influences because of their strong vocals and powerful performances. She has listed hip hop and R&B as her favorite music genres. Youngest member Minzy cited famous entertainer Michael Jackson , Rihanna , while leader CL said producer Teddy Park and American entertainers Madonna and Lauryn Hill are her role models. Dara states that singer-actress Uhm Jung-hwa is her inspiration, and idolizes Regine Velasquez , a well-known Filipino singer and also known as being Asia's songbird. She also enjoys Britney Spears 's style and music, citing her as a role model, whose songs she often sang to while growing up, during American interviews stateside for their New Evolution World Tour stop in California. When the group debuted, their song " Fire " and the subsequent live performances were dubbed unconventional and impressive. They won many awards on the weekly music shows, such as The Music Trend and Music Bank . "Fire" also brought them the Song of the Month and Rookie of the Month awards for May. " I Don't Care " brought them similar success and recognition and led 2NE1 to win the Song of the Year award at the 2009 Mnet Asian Music Awards . The same year, the group earned Cyworld Digital Music Awards for Top Selling Artist, Best Rookie Group, Bonsang Award, and Best Song for "I Don't Care".

    dbo:abstract " 2PM ( Korean : 투피엠 ) is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment . The current members are Jun. K (formerly known as Junsu), Nichkhun , Taecyeon , Wooyoung , Junho and Chansung . Former leader Jaebeom officially left the band in early 2010. The history of 2PM started when Korean musician Park Jin-young formed an eleven-member band known as One Day. Eventually the band was split into 2PM and a similar but independent group known as 2AM . 2PM debuted with the song \"10 Jeom Manjeome 10 Jeom\" ( 10점 만점에 10점 , lit. \"10 Points Out of 10 Points\"), which showcased their acrobatic dance styles. They achieved their first number 1 single with \"Again & Again\". Both singles featured on their first studio album, 01:59PM , released in 2009. The band went on to release another Korean album, known as Hands Up , in 2011. They made their Japanese debut later that year with Republic of 2PM . After more than a year, the group returned in 2013 with their third studio album Grown . In early September 2014, 2PM returned with their fourth studio album Go Crazy . On 15 June 2015, 2PM made a comeback with their fifth studio album No.5 . After much anticipation 2PM returned on 13 September 2016 with their sixth studio album Gentlemen's Game . Since July 2017, the group has been on an official hiatus. The members of 2PM all auditioned (except Nichkhun , who was scouted) to become part of JYP Entertainment. Some members already had experience in the entertainment industry, including Jun. K , who had won several singing competitions. Ok Taecyeon , Lee Junho and Hwang Chansung had participated in the show SuperStar Survival . Some of the members had previously lived in the U.S., former leader Jaebeom in the Seattle area, Nichkhun in Southern California , while Taecyeon spent seven years in Massachusetts before returning to Korea. Originally, the members of 2PM were part of a larger group known as One Day. A documentary called Hot Blood Men captured the group's training days. In this documentary, former member Jaebeom finished at the top spot and received the most fan votes. It also featured the elimination of three trainees from the group: Lee Swichi, Jeong Jinwoon , and Yoon Doo-joon were all cut. However, Jinwoon replaced Im Daehun upon the latter's withdrawal. By the end of the training process, One Day had been reduced to an eleven-member group. The band was then split into four-member ballad group 2AM and seven-member hip-hop group 2PM. While most Korean boy bands at the time adopted a \"pretty boy\" (Korean: kkonminam ) image, 2PM constructed a tough and macho beast-like image when they made their debut. By emphasizing their masculine images, 2PM created the \"jimseung-dol\" (jimseung means an animal or beast in Korean) phenomenon in 2008. Jaebeom was chosen to serve as the group's leader, as he was the oldest member and also the one where all the members acknowledged as the most talented one. He played key roles in several of the band's early singles and associated music videos. 2PM debuted with their single \" 10 Out of 10 \" ( 10점 만점에 10점 ) on 4 September 2008. In October 2008, they began to promote \"Only You\", another song from their debut mini album, Hottest Time of the Day . Concurrently, 2PM hosted the third season of Korean variety show Idol Army . In April 2009, the group released their second mini album, 2:00PM Time For Change , which they began promoting that month with the single \"Again and Again\". In May they won their first Mutizen Song award on M!Countdown , followed by two more and a Music Bank award. On 11 June, 2PM began promotions for \"Niga Mipda\" ( 니가 밉다 , lit. I Hate You ) on M!Countdown . In July 2PM achieved first place on the M!Countdown and Music Bank charts for the song \"Niga Mipda\". On 30 July, 2PM won the 'Only One Song' award on M!Countdown . At this time, 2PM also starred in the popular Korean variety show Wild Bunny. Later that year a controversy regarding Jaebeom emerged. On 4 September 2009, articles surfaced on the internet regarding Jaebeom's posts from 2005 on his personal Myspace account, in which he expressed his dislike for Korea while still a trainee for JYP Entertainment . These posts, leaked by a netizen who hacked his Myspace account, were taken out of context and severely misinterpreted by the Korean media. Jaebeom issued an apology regarding this matter. Although some demanded that Jaebeom should be forced out of 2PM, JYP Entertainment CEO Park Jin-young stated on 7 September lent the singer a vote of confidence, suggesting that he would remain in the group. Yet the following day, Jaebeom announced on his official fancafe that he would leave the group and return to the United States for a while to calm the situation. He planned to return to school and improve his understanding of music. At the same time, he apologized to his fellow band members for not being a good leader and older brother for them. He also promised to come back as a better person. Park Jin-young confirmed that 2PM would continue on as a six-member group. Due to the sensitive topic of Jaebeom's departure, 2PM withdrew for several weeks from their appearances on variety shows. Despite the controversy, the group went ahead with release of its first studio album. Known as 01:59PM , the album was released on 10 November 2009. Yet questions about Jaebeom remained. The day after the album's release, Park Jin-young announced that Jaebeom could return to 2PM if he wished to make a comeback, although the singer's return was not imminent. In support of Jaebeom, the six 2PM members decided to equally split their income from their first album with him. The album included tracks voiced by Jaebeom, although his face was excluded from the cover. The group finished re-filming their music video for \" Heartbeat \", the title song, without Jaebeom in October 2009. The group began promotional activities for the album on a variety of music shows, including M.Net O Good Concert , KBS Music Bank , MBC Music Core and SBS Inkigayo in November 2009. A week and a half after the album's release, 2PM performed at and was honored at the M.net Asian Music Awards with awards for Best Male Group and Artist of the Year (the latter being one of the three most prestigious awards at the show). The group paid homage to Jaebeom during their performance of \"Again & Again\". During the performance, a spotlight shone over Jaebeom's usual position in the dance formation, and his vocals played over the speakers without being replaced. In late November 2009, after two weeks of promotional activities for the 1:59PM , 2PM earned their first #1 on a TV music show (KBS Music Bank's \"K-Chart\") since the album's release, with \"Heartbeat\", which went on to take #1 on the K-Chart for three more weeks. In addition, \"Heartbeat\" achieved the \"Mutizen\" song award Triple Crown on SBS Inkigayo by being the #1 song the Inkigayo \"Take 7\" chart for three weeks, the maximum amount of time for which a nominated song is eligible to win. On 30 December 2009, at Korean Broadcasting System (KBS)'s end of the year Music Festival, \"Again & Again\" was recognized as \"Song of the Year\", winning with 57,060 votes. 2PM's second single from 01:59PM was \"Tired of Waiting\". The song was performed live for the first time at the SBS Music Festival in December 2009. 2PM's promotion for the album ended with their SBS Inkigayo performance in January 2010. In February 2010, JYP Entertainment announced that Jaebeom would not return to 2PM, as his contract with the company had been permanently terminated, with the agreement of all 6 members. A combined fan meeting and press conference was held two days later with the six remaining members of 2PM and JYP Entertainment CEO Choi Jungwook in attendance. Various 2PM fansites were shut down immediately after the conference as a protest of Jaebeom's termination. Management announced that although 2PM would move forward with six members, a new leader would not be chosen to replace Jaebeom. In April 2010, the band released Don't Stop Can't Stop , a mini-album consisting of six tracks. The group intended for the release to illustrate a stronger side of themselves than did their previous releases. The group made their television performance comeback on Mnet's music program M! Countdown in April 2010. 2PM served as the opening act for nine Wonder Girls summer shows in the United States in 2010. 2PM also performed at the eighth annual Korea Times Music Festival in Los Angeles, California in May 2010, and at the Dream Concert in Seoul, South Korea in May 2010. In May 2010, 2PM released the song \"What's Your Celebration?\" for the FIFA 2010 World Cup . The song samples K'Naan 's Wavin' Flag . In July 2010, Taecyeon and Wooyoung left their position of MCs at SBS Inkigayo. The next month, Wooyoung also left Winwin to concentrate on 2PM's busy schedule. The 1st concerts took place on 31 July 1 August (in Seoul) & 7, 8 August (in Busan) ( 2AM & Miss A were invited as the guests of the concert). More than 12,000 fans attended 2PM's first concerts in Seoul. 2PM performed all their hit-songs since 2008 plus solo performance from each member. 2PM held two encore concerts in Seoul on 4–5 September to celebrate their second anniversary. In October 2010, 2PM released their fourth EP, Still 2:00PM , with the lead single \"I'll Be Back\" staying at number one for two consecutive weeks in the Music Bank . In November 2010, Still 2:00PM debuted unexpectedly on the 13th spot of the Billboard's World Album-Chart though no promotions for the album were made in the United States. 2PM was granted the \"Most Popular Asian Singer\" award at the Mandarin Music Honors 2010 in China. The group attended the event on 18 October at Wukesong Arena; it was the tenth annual MMH. Previously, Rain, Jang Nara, and Shin Seung Hoon have each taken home the \"Year’s Best Korean Singer\" award, but this is the first time a Korean artist has won the \"Most Popular Asian Singer\" award. 2PM performed \"Heartbeat\" and \"I’ll Be Back\". 2PM officially made their Japanese debut in December 2010 with their first live event in Japan at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Gymnasium, a place well known for sumo games. The platinum showcase was called \"2PM 1st Contact in JAPAN\" LIVE. In May 2011, 2PM released their Japanese debut-single, \"Take Off.\" The song was featured as an ending song in the Blue Exorcist anime series. 2PM’s first Japanese concert tour, known as the \"2PM 1st Japan Tour 2011 Take Off,\" began in Sapporo on 6 May and ended a week later in Tokyo. In June 2011, JYP Entertainment released the track list of their upcoming second studio album, which would be known as \"Hands Up.\" The album was released later that month on 20 June 2011. For the first time, the album featured two songs composed by 2PM members: \"HOT\" by Minjun and \"Give it to Me\" by Junho. The promotion period for the album was short; it ended just one month after the album's release. This allowed the band to prepare for their Japanese promotions and for their \"Hands Up Asia Tour.\" The 2PM Show began broadcasting in July 2011 on SBS’s E!TV cable channel and featured all six members. It was the first time 2PM would emcee a program with their name on it. On 30 November 2011, 2PM released their first studio album in Japanese language, Republic of 2PM . It contains all of their Japanese singles released to date (Take Off, I'm Your Man and Ultra Lover) plus the Japanese version of their most recent Korean hit song \"Hands Up\", as well as a new song composed by Minjun for Japanese fans called \"Hanarete Itemo\" (離れていても, Even When We're Apart) and 4 other completely new songs. The main point of the album artwork motif is a taste of the 1950s and 1960s. Oricon released their sales for 2011, announcing that 2PM was the 2nd best selling new artist in Japan, only behind Johnny & Associates 's group Kis-My-FT2 , with 990 million yen (12.68 million USD) only in singles, albums and DVDs sales. In April 2012, 2PM announced plans to release a documentary film with 2AM , to be known as Beyond The One Day , in Japan. One Day refers to the group from which 2PM and 2AM both split. On 13 April, they released the trailer for the film. After more than a year, 2PM made their Korean comeback in 2013 with their third studio album, Grown . A teaser for the music video of \"Comeback When You Hear This Song\", the lead single of their album, was released on 2 May 2013 on 2PM's official YouTube account. The full music video was released on 6 May 2013 along with 10 songs from the album. This album is a two title track album, the track \"A.D.T.O.Y.\" was released on 11 May 2013. As part of their promotion activities for the album, from 2 May to 31 July 2013, the group took part in the 2PM G+Star Zone exhibition, at the Apgujeongrodeo Station .

In 2014, during the filming of the music video of the group's upcoming comeback, a fire broke out on the set of the music video. Authorities stated after the fire had been handled that the fire was relatively small and had been controlled by the time the fire team arrived, and apparently started when a spark from some fireworks which were being used in the music video landed on a sponge. All the members and staff present at the time were confirmed to be unharmed. The long-awaited comeback that was to be in April was postponed by JYP Entertainment and 2PM due to their individual activities, for early June with a possibility that they will return in July at the earliest or even later in the year. According to ALLKPOP , JYP Entertainment rep told Newsen on the 14th, \"2PM's comeback has been delayed for the time being. It will be in the latter-half of this year but the exact date has not been decided yet.\" On 31 August, 2pm released teaser photos for their comeback album GO CRAZY! and revealed that their comeback would be released on 10 September. They then released individual teasers on 2 September before the official release of the song. On 10 September, the group released their official music video for the dance track \"GO CRAZY!\" on JYP Entertainment's official YouTube account and garnered over 1 million views in the first 24 hours. They made their comeback performance on m!countdown on the subsequent day. 2PM's fifth studio album, No.5 , was released 15 June 2015. Nine of the twelve songs on the album were written by the members, with the title song \"My House\" written by Jun. K .

Their sixth studio album was released on 13 September, titled Gentlemen's Game along with the new single \"Promise (I'll Be)\".

The show ran from 21 July 2009 to 1 September 2009, with seven episodes aired; the airing of the final episode, which coincidentally featured the members engaged in a \"Leader Olympics\" game to select a new leader, was postponed indefinitely due to Jaebeom 's internet controversy and his subsequent departure from the group. In addition, Taecyeon and Wooyoung have been hosting SBS ( Seoul Broadcasting System )'s weekly music show Inkigayo , while Jaebeom and Chansung have also made regular appearances on 'Introducing Star Friends'.

On the edition of June 1, the single reached number one on the Billboard K-pop Hot 100. On June 28, 4Minute released the summer single "Is It Poppin'?", also written and produced by Brave Brothers . In an interview with Newsen, a Cube Entertainment spokesperson said that the song was "neither a sexy or charismatic concept, but a cute concept – a hip hop dance song that goes well with the summer feel." Its Korean title "물 좋아?" (romanized: Mul Joha?, lit. "How's the Water?"), is a slang phrase that men use to ask if the girls in a club are hot. KBS announced that the lyrics for "Is It Poppin?" were unqualified for broadcast because they contained the English word "ass". 4Minute planned to remove the word from the video for re-evaluation. Billboard K-Town columnist Jeff Benjamin tweeted whether the Brave Brothers' new thing was to sample old-school-sounding R&B. Benjamin also noted that similarly to "What's Your name," "Brave Brothers uses a similar formula for 4minute's new track, but it all feels smoother." He explains the track "uses subdued snares, a twinkling Ellie Goulding "Lights"-esque sample and a soft, recurring vocal sample. Despite sounding busy on paper, the song flows nicely together as a sweet little blend of R&B and electro-pop." The song peaked at number 9 on the Gaon Digital Chart and number 6 on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 , selling 606,713 digital downloads. In September, 4Minute finished its contract with Universal Music Japan, and shut down the group's Japanese official website as well as its fanclub site, 4Nia Japan. On January 20, 2014, Brave Brothers released the single "Only Gained Weight" which featured 4Minute members Hyuna, Gayoon and Sohyun; the song reached number five on the Melon chart and Gaon. The group's fifth mini-album, 4Minute World , along with its featured track “ Whatcha Doin' Today ?”, was released on March 17. The group promoted the song on various Korean music shows along with the track "Wait A Minute". The shows included KBS's Music Bank, MBC's Show! Music Core, SBS's Inkigayo and Mnet's M! Countdown from March 20–23. The single became the group's first single to debut at number 1 in Korea. On March 30, 4Minute won against 2NE1 and Girls' Generation on Inkigayo . And on April 3, they also won on M! Countdown which took place at Japan. On June 7, 4Minute performed "Whatcha Doin' Today" on Dream Concert along with other Kpop idols including their labelmates Beast , A Pink and BTOB . On October 17, during a performance at a local festival in Seongnam, south of Seoul in South Korea, at least 16 people were killed and 11 injured in an accident where a ventilation grate that people were standing on collapsed. On October 28, 4Minute was chosen as one of the 10 winners of " Style Icon Awards " for their trendy, stylish, and influential fashion, and also performed at the awards show.

    rdfs:label "After_School" ;
    dbo:abstract " After School ( Hangul : 애프터스쿨), stylized as AFTERSCHOOL in Japan, is a South Korean girl group with an admissions and graduation concept formed by Pledis Entertainment . As of December 2019, After School only consists of one member. After School officially debuted in January 2009 with \"AH!\" from the single album New Schoolgirl . Following the addition of Uee in April of that year, they released \" Diva \", which won the \"Rookie of the Month\" award at the Cyworld Digital Music Awards . Pledis Entertainment then announced the graduation of Soyoung, before adding Raina and Nana for the release of \" Because of You \" in November 2009, which was an instant hit and became a commercial and critical success for the group, with the song winning a \"triple crown\" on Inkigayo and was the best selling song of December 2009, eventually becoming one of the best selling K-Pop singles of all time. [A] Follow-up singles \" Bang! \", \" Shampoo \", \" Flashback \" and \" First Love \" further consolidated their domestic and international popularity and saw the additions of Lizzy , E-Young and Kaeun, as well as the graduations of original members Bekah and Kahi . In 2010, the three newest members at that time formed the group's first subunit, Orange Caramel , and in 2011 a second subunit was formed when the group was split into two teams, A.S. Red and A.S. Blue, for the release of their fourth single album. In the beginning of 2011, the group signed with Avex Trax to begin their promotions in Japan. The group made their first official appearance in Japan by collaborating with singer Namie Amuro for a song from her collaboration album Checkmate! , titled \"Make it Happen\". The song went onto win Best Collaboration at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Japan . The group's debut single, a remake of their Korean hit \" Bang! \", was released in August that year and charted at number seven on Oricon's Weekly Singles Chart. Follow-up singles \" Diva \" and \" Rambling Girls\" / \"Because of You \" had similar success and helped to establish a fanbase in Japan before the release of the group's debut Japanese album, Playgirlz (2012). Their second Japanese album, Dress to Kill , fronted by the Shinichi Osawa produced singles \" Heaven \" and \" Shh \", was released in 2014. After School received attention for their unique live performances, often incorporating different performance styles into their songs, including drums, tap dancing and pole dancing , which garnered praise from Billboard who referred to the group as the \"top performers in K-pop\". The group also ranked number five in Billboard 's list of the \"Top 10 K-Pop Girl Groups of the Past Decade\". They have also won numerous awards throughout their career, including the Korean Popular Culture and Arts Award and the Idol Music Best of the Best Award in the 19th South Korea Culture & Entertainment Awards, and have sold over 12 million copies of their singles domestically. From 2015 onward After School halted group promotions and the members have embarked on individual music, acting and modeling careers. In 2019, Lizzy revealed that all members had gradually gone their separate ways, however the group has not officially disbanded. After School was first formed following Kahi 's departure from Korean-American girl group S-Blush, as Kahi began planning to produce a new group together with the current CEO of Pledis Entertainment . The first member other than Kahi was Bekah , who was a trainee while Kahi was in S-Blush. With Kahi's recommendation, Bekah was brought from Hawaii to South Korea. They were then introduced to Jungah , followed by Soyoung and Jooyeon , forming a five-member group. After School as a group first made an unofficial appearance on December 29, 2008 at the SBS Song Festival. Kahi and Jungah performed \"Play Girlz\" alongside Son Dam Bi whilst the remaining members, Soyoung, Jooyeon and Bekah served as backup dancers for Son Dam Bi's performance at the event. In the beginning of 2009, a few days before After School's debut, Pledis Entertainment announced that the group's music concept was heavily influenced by the Pussycat Dolls . On January 15, the group released their debut single album New Schoolgirl . The album had three songs: the lead single \"Ah!\", \"Play Girlz\" and \"Bad Guy\" (나쁜놈). On January 17, After School made their debut stage on television music program Music Core . Following promotional activities for \"AH!\", After School planned to continue to promote \"Bad Guy\" from their debut single New Schoolgirl . However, the track was deemed unsuitable and was banned from broadcast because of a single word of profanity was in the lyrics. In April 2009, a new member Uee joined the group. The group then released their second single, \" Diva \" on April 9, 2009. They first performed the song on April 9, 2009 on M! Countdown . After School went on to win the \"Rookie of the Month\" award for the month of April 2009 at the Cyworld Digital Music Awards with the single. On 21 May, the group released a cover of Morning Musume 's \" Love Machine \", entitled \"Dream Girl\". In July, it was announced that the group would collaborate with Son Dam-bi for digital single \"Amoled\". It was released on July 16, as part of a promotion deal with Samsung . After School also became the opening act for The Pussycat Dolls 's Doll Domination Tour along with label-mate Son Dam-bi for the Asian dates of the tour. On October 29, Soyoung officially graduated from the group to pursue an acting career. Two new members were then added to the group, Raina and Nana . On November 25, After School released their new single \" Because of You \". The song marked a change for the group to a more mature and sophisticated concept, and became extremely popular, winning three Mutizen awards for the group on SBS' Inkigayo. At the start of 2010, the group won the Best Rookie Award at both the Billboard Japan Music Awards and Seoul Music Awards . On March 25, After School released their third single album Bang! with new member Lizzy where the group took on a marching band concept. Kahi revealed that she was inspired after watching the American film Drumline , and had always wanted to do a marching band concept ever since she took to the stage as an After School member. The group practiced playing the drums for five months with a trainer for the single. The title track entered the Gaon Weekly Chart at number 2 and reached number 29 on the 2010 Gaon year-end digital chart with 2,374,731 digital downloads sold. In June 2010, Raina, Nana, and Lizzy formed a sub-unit, revealed to be named Orange Caramel , and released their first mini-album .

Orange Caramel debuted on June 16, with the title track \"Magic Girl\". Their debut mini-album, The First Mini Album , was released on June 21, 2010. The album was a commercial success, peaking at No. 2 on the Gaon Chart with the lead single \"Magic Girl\" peaking at No. 18.

Despite never leaving the top 12 during the show's run, and ranking 1st for more weeks than any other contestant, Kaeun placed 14th during the finale of Produce 48 and therefore failed to make it to the final line-up. On October 18, 2018, former member Lizzy revealed that Kaeun is preparing to debut in a new girl group following her success on the show.

Once again, Apink worked with common collaborator Black Eyed Pilseung for the title track, who had previously produced \"Only One\". With this comeback, Apink took on a different direction conceptually, with a bolder image and a more sophisticated sound. \"I'm So Sick\" topped several music charts in South Korea after its release. The album itself topped the Gaon chart and led Apink to reach their highest-ever position on Billboard's World Albums chart at No. 11. The success of the song and album further led to Apink making their debut on Billboard's Social 50 chart, opening at No. 39. Billboard have chosen the title track as one of 20 Best K-Pop Songs of 2018, noting that \"it felt a bit meta -- as the six-member girl group swapped out their girlish image for something far more compelling.\". In August, Apink embarked on another Asia tour, visiting Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Singapore, Tokyo and Taipei. On December 1, Apink received the Top 10 Artists award at the MelOn Music Awards for their song \"I'm So Sick\".

The concert, which was announced in December, sold out all tickets three minutes after its announcement. This was followed by concert Apink Japan Live Pink Collection in Tokyo, held on February 3 and 4. On January 7, Apink released their eighth mini album Percent , along with the single \"%%(Eung Eung)\", composed by frequent collaborator Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Goon. The single, which continued the new direction taken by the group with \"I'm So Sick\", topped several music charts in South Korea after its release and peaked at No. 17 on the Gaon digital chart, while the album reached No. 3 on the Korean chart and No. 14 on the Billboard World Albums chart. To promote the new album, Apink performed \"%%(Eung Eung)\" on various music shows, along with B-side track \"Hug Me\", for a period of two weeks beginning on January 9. On March 13, 2020, Play M Entertainment announced that Apink would be making a comeback some time in April. Apink's image and music style are often compared to first-generation idol girl groups S.E.S. and Fin.K.L . Apink has an innocent and girlish image, unusual among girl groups' sexy concepts. In 2012, member Oh Ha-young said, \"Other girl groups these days tend to highlight their dancing skills and sexy looks, but our concept was an innocent and pure image. I think that's why the audience felt comfortable with us\". However, with releases like 2014's \" Luv \" and 2015's \" Remember \" group deviated, and showed a more mature and sensitive side to the group while still retaining their trademark innocence. Apink's music generally fits within the bubblegum pop genre, with signature cheery lyrics. Jeff Benjamin of Billboard commented that \" My My \" recalled early 2000s bubblegum pop, \" NoNoNo \" was influenced by 1980s synth-pop and \" Luv \" recalls 1990s hip-hop while blending it with ballad melancholy, a fall-themed song of lost love. \" Mr Chu \", released in spring 2014, continues a slew of Apink's trademark bubblegum series which is 'very Apink'. Meanwhile, title track \" Remember \" is a 'cheery synth-pop tune that reminisces about a love during the summertime,' and 'features a quick rhythm and vintage sound to beat the summer heat,'. Their 2016 title track, \" Only One \" is described as mature, blending in mid tempo R&B and dance-pop with subtle hip-hop beats while song like \" Boom Pow Love \" shows a far more urban-pop, energetic vibe with pulsing beats compared to their previous hits. With the release of 2018's \"I'm So Sick\", Apink showed a shift in their style of music, moving towards a more mature and sophisticated sound. The track, with its use of autotune, synth and house beats, and its lyrical content of having 'not even one' bit of feeling left for an ex, makes \"I'm So Sick\" a much bolder track than what Apink is known to put out. 2019's \"%%(Eung Eung)\" does much of the same. Its use of 'izzy snyths, snapping beats, and slapping percussion as the members sing about the type of person one should love' make %%(Eung Eung) another song that is a departure from much of Apink's earlier work. Korean Tours Japan Tours Asia Tours American Tours Apink started with a documentary program titled Apink News , which aired on the cable channel TrendE for three seasons (2011–2012). They appeared in another reality show, Birth of a Family , from 2011–2012. In 2014, Apink appeared on another reality show, MBC Every 1 's Showtime , and were the subject of the third season. The group has won awards at shows such as the 26th Golden Disc Awards , 21st Seoul Music Awards , and 13th Mnet Asian Music Awards . Their first music program win was on M Countdown on January 5, 2012, for \"My My\" from their second EP Snow Pink . [ citation needed ] " ;

[ citation needed ] On June 30, 2018, WM Entertainment confirmed that Jinyoung and Baro had left the agency following the end of their contracts. Their activities with the group remain in discussion. On November 16, WM Entertainment has announced that B1A4 members Jinyoung and Baro will not promote with the group for the time being, with the remaining three members - CNU, Sandeul, and Gongchan - to continue promoting as B1A4. The group has been dubbed \"countryside-dols\" (countryside idols) by the Korean media due to the fact that all of the members of B1A4 are from the countryside: Jinyoung is from Chungju , North Chungcheong Province ; CNU from Cheongju , North Chungcheong Province ; Sandeul from Busan ; Baro from Gwangju , South Jeolla Province ; and Gongchan from Suncheon , South Jeolla Province . They were also referred to as \"blood-dols\" (blood idols) in reference to the origins of their name (which references the group members' blood types), as well as \"paper-dols\" (paper idols) because of the paper classification A4. In an effort to distinguish themselves, B1A4 had also promoted a nickname \"saessakdol\" ( 새싹돌 , \"sprout-dol\") and created a so-called \"saessakchum\" ( 새싹춤 , \"sprout dance\"), which was showcased in various shows including Quiz to Change the World . In January 2015, B1A4 members hugged Muslim female fans in a meet and greet session in Malaysia. Internet commenters called for the organizers to be charged afterwards. B1A4 have participated in philanthropic acts throughout their career. On May 31, 2012, it was reported that B1A4 had visited a fan's home to prepare a meal and help take care of the fan's ill mother. On August 31 that year, the group donated 140 kg of rice garlands initially donated by fans to Seoul SOS Youth Camp in Yangcheon District . On September 1, 2012, B1A4 held a mini concert at the Wonju Market to help raise awareness for traditional markets. As they hosted their first solo concert, BABA B1A4 , fans from all over the world sent gifts and donations to B1A4, which the group then donated to charity. On July 19, 2013, as B1A4 prepared for their second solo concert, B1A4 asked fans for school supplies rather than flower wreaths. They were working with CJ Group ’s charity foundation “Donor’s Camp” to support the education of children who are in need. The group donated part of the proceeds from their third solo concert to Seoul Arts College's matriculation ceremony, which took place on February 27, 2014 at the Olympic Park Olympic Hall. Seoul Arts College used the donation to purchase rice to be given to the charities Gangnam Start Center and Gangnam Vision Center. In December that year, they participated in a charity event to raise funds to provide those in need with coal briquettes for heating. " ;

    dbo:abstract " BTS ( Korean : 방탄소년단 ; RR : Bangtan Sonyeondan ), also known as the Bangtan Boys , is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2010. The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group have staged several world tours. The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single \" Mic Drop \". The band is the first Korean act to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums Love Yourself: Answer (2018), Map of the Soul: Persona (2019) and Map of the Soul: 7 (2020), making BTS the fastest group since the Beatles to earn four number one albums in less than two years. Love Yourself: Answer also broke South Korea's Gaon Album Chart 's all-time monthly record previously set by Love Yourself: Tear and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States. Having sold over 20 million albums on the Gaon Music Chart , BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the best-selling album in South Korea with Map of the Soul: 7 . BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the IFPI 's Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won Top Social Artist three years in a row and Top Duo/Group at the 26th Billboard Music Awards . Featured on Time 's international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and Time 's 100 most influential people in the world (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname \" Princes of Pop \". Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. BTS are ranked #4 of Billboard 's Top Social Artist of the 2010s, and are the highest group on the list. During their Love Yourself World Tour , BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium ; and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history. Billboard ranked BTS at #45 on their Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list, being the highest-ranked Asian as well as the only non-English speaking act on the list. As of 2019, BTS are purportedly worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, or 0.3 percent of the country's GDP. BTS attracted one in every 13 foreign tourists that visited South Korea and were cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018. Following the establishment of their Love Myself anti-violence campaign in partnership with UNICEF , BTS addressed the United Nations 73rd General Assembly and became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language. The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan ( Korean : 방탄소년단 ; Hanja : 防彈 少年 團 ), literally meaning \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts\". According to member J-Hope , the name signifies the group's desire \"to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets\". In Japan, they are known as Bōdan Shōnendan ( 防弾少年団 ) , which translates similarly. In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for \"Beyond the Scene\" as part of their new brand identity. This extended their name to mean \"growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward.\" BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping. BTS was originally supposed to be a hip-hop group similar to YG Entertainment's 1TYM , but between their initial formation and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided that the contemporary youth needed instead \"a hero who can lend them a shoulder to lean on, even without speaking a single word\". The group was meant to debut in 2011 and featured on several tracks by artists such as 2AM and Lee Seung-gi before their debut was postponed and the group was reorganized into a more traditional idol group. The lineup was then finalized with Jin , Suga , J-Hope , RM , Jimin , V , and Jungkook in 2012. Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud . On June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool , the first installment in their \"school trilogy\" series, simultaneously with its lead single \"No More Dream\", which peaked at number 124 in Korea before quickly falling off the charts. While the album peaked at number five in South Korea and eventually sold over 145,000 copies, it was not a major hit, selling only 24,000 copies in 2013. Their subsequent single “We Are Bulletproof Pt. 2” failed to chart. In 2 Cool 4 Skool , BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound with scratches from the 1980s-90s and excessively fierce visuals. From their inception, BTS was convinced that telling their story was the only way for the younger generation to relate to their music. The lyrics of the album primarily reflected on the misunderstanding and prejudice towards them, criticism of the society that diminishes their dreams, and their anxiety and determination towards their future. During the production of the album, Suga and RM rewrote the lyrics of “No More Dream” more than 20 times. The single album's release was followed by several appearances on Korean music shows. Despite being unpolished, these early live performances demonstrated BTS' potential with their intense and charismatic stage presence. Expanding their endeavors to Japan, \"No More Dream\" was later re-recorded in Japanese and released in June 2014. In September 2013, BTS released the second part to their \"school trilogy,” the extended play O!RUL8,2? , along with its single \"N.O,” which peaked at number 92 in Korea. The EP peaked at number four in Korea and has sold over 160,000 copies to date, including 34,000 copies in its release year. Musically, BTS did not fundamentally change their sound as compared with 2 Cool 4 Skool , utilizing fiery rapping along with trap beats, brass, and soulful melodies . Lyrically, the EP expanded on the theme of dreams and happiness, revealing their frustration under the harsh Korean education system and their determination to confront the struggle of proving themselves. Despite several performances on Korean music shows, the single quickly fell off the charts. That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV 's Rookie King Channel Bangtan , based on a fake broadcast station, \"Channel Bangtan\", through which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea . At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, including the 5th Melon Music Awards , 28th Golden Disc Awards and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards . The last act to their \"school trilogy\", the EP Skool Luv Affair , was released in January 2014 and topped the Gaon Album Chart , selling 100,000 copies in 2014 and over 250,000 copies overall. It also marked BTS’ first appearance on Billboard 's World Albums Chart, peaking at number three. The album was supported by the singles \"Boy in Luv\" (Korean: 상남자; RR: Sang-namja ) and \"Just One Day\" (Korean: 하루만; RR: Haruman ), which peaked at number 45 and number 149 in Korea, respectively. While Skool Luv Affair musically retained much of their hip-hop influences with the incorporation of R&B and hard rock, the album coincided with a thematic shift from dreams and happiness to love, focusing on school-age and youthful love. Following Skool Luv Affair’s release, BTS made several appearances on Korean music shows and held their first fan meeting that March with an audience of 3,000 fans in Seoul . That July, BTS held their first concert in the United States in West Hollywood for free to an audience of 200 fans. In August, the group also made their first appearance at KCON in Los Angeles . In August 2014, BTS released their first Korean studio album, Dark & Wild , which peaked at number two in Korea and sold over 200,000 copies total. It was supported by two singles: \"Danger\" and \"War of Hormone\" (Korean: 호르몬 전쟁; RR: Horeumon Jeonjaeng ), which peaked at number 58 and number 173 in Korea, respectively. The album served as a narrative extension of the “school trilogy” and a transition into their next series. Musically, the album fused the grungy electric guitar sounds of rock within the framework of hip-hop and continued to expand their sound towards R&B . The central theme of the album's lyrics focused on expressing the sentiments of maturing, youthful desires, and impatience for romance. During production of the album, BTS recorded their single \"Danger\" in a makeshift studio in a garage in Los Angeles. Following several appearances on Korean music shows, BTS embarked on their first concert tour , 2014 BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet , from October to December, held in various halls and theaters in six cities: Seoul, Kobe , Tokyo , Manila , Singapore , and Bangkok . Their first Japanese studio album, Wake Up (2014), released that December, peaked at number three on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart and sold 28,000 copies. Along with re-recorded Japanese versions of older songs, it also contained the original tracks \"Wake Up\" and \"The Stars.\" In support of the album, BTS held their 1st Japan Tour 2015 Wake Up: Open Your Eyes in February 2015 to an audience of 25,000 fans in four cities. After ending their Japan tour, BTS held their second solo concert in Korea, BTS Live Trilogy Episode I: BTS Begins, in March to a crowd of 6,500 fans. Shifting their sound and image from solely aggressive, masculine hip hop to more diverse styles, BTS wanted to express the beauty and anxiousness of \"youth\" and settled on the title of \"花樣年華\" (Korean: 화양연화; RR: Hwayangyeonhwa ), loosely interpreted to define \"youth\" as \"the most beautiful moment in life.\" Their third EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 (March 2015), explored the growth and emotional agony of youth as well as its playful and uplifting sides. Fuse included it as the only Korean album on their list of the \"27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far.\" The EP has sold over 415,000 copies to date. Its lead single \" I Need U \" was BTS' first top five hit in Korea and garnered BTS first ever music show win on SBS MTV 's The Show . While its second single, \"Dope (Korean: 쩔어; RR: Jjeoreo )\", only peaked at number 44 in Korea, it peaked at number three on Billboard ' s World Digital Songs Chart and became their first music video to accrue over 100 million views on YouTube in October. The group began the world tour extension of their Red Bullet Tour in June, titled 2015 Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet , visiting cities throughout Asia, Oceania, North America, and Latin America. Their fourth Japanese single, \"For You\", was released on June 17 to celebrate the first anniversary of their Japanese debut and topped Oricon 's daily chart, selling over 42,000 copies within its first day. BTS later performed at Japan's Summer Sonic Festival on August 15 and 16. In November, BTS commenced their third concert tour, 2015 BTS LIVE \"The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: On Stage\" , debuting their new song and the lead single from their fourth EP The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 , \"Run\", during the Seoul dates. Thematically, the EP focused more on the serious and speculative aspects of youth, touching on the pursuit of success, loneliness, affection for their origins, and the suffering of the younger generation due to unfavorable conditions in current society. Critically, it was praised as the successful merging of the style of The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 with BTS' initial identity. The album topped the weekly Gaon Album and Billboard World Albums charts and BTS became the first K-pop act to remain atop the latter for multiple weeks. It also marked their first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 171 with over 5,000 copies. BTS were awarded Best World Performer at the 17th Mnet Asian Music Awards in recognition of their international fan base. Their first Korean compilation album and the finale to their \"youth series\", The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever , was released in May 2016. It included three new singles: the top 40 hit \"Epilogue: Young Forever\", the top 10 hit \" Fire \" (Korean: 불타오르네; RR: Bultaoreune ), and the top 20 hit \" Save Me \". The album topped Gaon Weekly Chart in Korea for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number 107 on the U.S. Billboard 200 . The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever later won BTS' first major Korean award for Album of the Year at the 8th Melon Music Awards . BTS embarked on their Asia tour extension, 2016 BTS LIVE \"The Most Beautiful Moment in Life On Stage: Epilogue\" , from May to August, visiting 10 cities and performing to 144,000 fans. During their tour, BTS held a landmark two-day concert at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul in May, and performed as first time headliners at both U.S. KCON shows held that year in Newark (June) and Los Angeles (July), to sold-out audiences. In line with their other successes, they became the first K-pop group to receive their own Twitter emoji in May 2016. In September 2016, BTS released their second Japanese studio album Youth . It sold over 44,000 copies on its first day of release and peaked at number one in Japan . Pre-orders for their second Korean studio album Wings , released in October 2016, accumulated over 500,000 copies within the first week. Wings combined the themes of youth presented in their previous \"youth series\" with temptation and adversity and, for the first time as a major group effort, included seven solo tracks that demonstrated each members' potential and individuality as independent musicians. The album was generally well-received by critics, with Rolling Stone naming it \"one of the most conceptually and sonically ambitious pop albums of 2016, \" while Fuse praised the \"vulnerable and honest song material\" and diverse tracks. The lead single \"Blood Sweat & Tears\" achieved a music chart \"all-kill\" in South Korea and became their first number one hit on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart. Its music video gained over 6 million views within 24 hours, breaking the previous record held on YouTube for the highest number of views of a K-pop group music video within 24 hours. Wings opened at number 26 on the U.S. Billboard 200, the highest chart ranking ever for a K-pop album, and BTS became the first Korean group to top the Billboard Social 50 chart that month. It was their first \"million seller\" album, moving over 1.5 million copies in South Korea that year and became the best-selling album in Gaon Album Chart history at the time. BTS were the first artist not from a \"Big Three\" entertainment company ( SM , YG and JYP ) to win Artist of the Year at the 18th Mnet Asian Music Awards in December. In February 2017, BTS released the repackaged edition of Wings (2016) , entitled You Never Walk Alone . Pre-orders of the repackage reached over 700,000 copies, breaking the record for most albums sold in a month. The repackage included an additional four tracks that offered consolation and encouragement to its listeners. Its lead single, \" Spring Day \" (Korean: 봄날; RR: Bomnal ) met critical praise as \"an intelligent, compelling and elegantly restrained study of loss and longing\" that \"deliberately avoids cliché pomp and drama\" by Dazed Digital . Embodying nostalgia and sorrow, it opened a new chapter in BTS' aesthetics and lyricism and attracted fans across generational boundaries. Upon release, \"Spring Day\" topped eight of the major South Korean online music charts, as well as Gaon, and crashed Melon 's digital chart due to the high influx of user traffic. It also entered the U.S. Billboard ' s Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart at number 15 with \"zero promotions.\" As evidence of its staying power, \"Spring Day\" is the longest-charting song on Melon by an idol group to date. \"Spring Day\" later won Best Song of the Year at the 9th Melon Music Awards . In conjunction with the release of You Never Walk Alone , BTS commenced their second world tour, 2017 BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour , from February to December. The tour visited 12 countries including Brazil, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States and gathered 550,000 fans. On the tour, BTS began to play progressively larger venues, moving from halls into arenas and domes. Tickets for the North American leg sold out within minutes and two additional shows were added due to high demand, making BTS the first K-pop act to sell out arenas in the United States. After completing their North American leg, BTS attended the 24th Billboard Music Awards in May and won Top Social Artist , becoming the first Korean group awarded a Billboard Music Award. Celebrating Korean music icon Seo Taiji 's 25th anniversary as a part of his anniversary project \"Time: Traveler\", BTS released a remake of Seo Taiji's 1995 classic \" Come Back Home \" in July 2017, reworking the sound and lyrics to similar sentiments toward societal change that Seo Taiji argued for in his songs. BTS was later invited by Seo Taiji to perform as backup vocalists and dancers for eight songs in his Seoul Olympic Stadium concert held early September. During the concert, Seo Taiji acknowledged BTS' thematic similarities to his music and recognized the group as his musical successors, declaring, \"This is your generation now. Show them.\" Following the depiction of growth and temptation in Wings (2016) and consolation in You Never Walk Alone (2017), BTS embarked on their \"Love Yourself\" series which sought the enlightenment of self-love through the \" 起承轉結 \" (Korean: 기승전결; RR: G iseungjeongyeol ) narrative sequence of \"beginning, development, turn, and conclusion.\" In September 2017, BTS released the first part of the series, their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her and featured music from the Chainsmokers ' Andrew Taggart for the track \"Best of Me\". The EP was supported by two singles: the lead single \" DNA \" and a Steve Aoki remix of their song \" Mic Drop \" featuring American rapper Desiigner . In the narrative sequence, the EP represented the \"承,\" or \"development\" of the series and is considered by RM to be one of the major turning points in BTS' career. Within the larger narrative, Love Yourself: Her described the joy and happiness of falling in love. Sonically, the EP served as \"a dual exploration of the group's electro-pop and hip-hop leanings,\" with the first half consisting of “dance tracks that emphasize the group's vocals\" while in the second half \"the act's hip-hop side arrives in earnest...delivering powerful rap performances.\" Commercially, BTS continued to hit new career heights with the Love Yourself: Her EP, debuting at number seven on the Billboard 200 with 31,000 album-equivalent units. In Korea, the EP sold over 1.2 million copies on the Gaon Album Chart in its first month, achieving the highest monthly album sales in the chart's history and the highest on any Korean chart in 16 years, second to g.o.d 's Chapter 4 album in 2001. The single \"DNA\" was released simultaneously with the EP and debuted at number two in Korea. Its music video broke the previous record for most viewed K-pop group music video within the first 24 hours with more than 20 million views on YouTube . \"DNA\" also became the group's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 85, making BTS the first K-pop boy band to do so and the second Korean act with a Korean-language song. The following week, \"DNA\" rose to number 67 and became the highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 for a K-pop group, beating Wonder Girls ' previous record at number 76. The following single \" Mic Drop (Remix) \" peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first top 40 entry for a K-pop group on the chart. Both \"Mic Drop Remix\" and \"DNA\" were later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) making BTS the first and only Korean artist to receive two certifications. \"Mic Drop\" went on to receive Platinum certification in November 2018, making BTS the first Korean group with a Platinum-certified single in the United States. In December 2017, \"DNA\" and \"Mic Drop\" were released as a triple-A side single in Japan with the new song \"Crystal Snow\", which topped the Oricon Chart and became the highest-selling single from a K-pop artist within a week. The single sold more than 380,000 copies by the end of the year and BTS became the only foreign artist to have a single certified double platinum by the RIAJ that year. In November 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to perform at the American Music Awards , raising their profile internationally. That same month, Guinness World Records revealed that BTS had earned a spot in their 2018 edition for \"having the world's most Twitter engagements for a music group\". In December, they also became the first K-pop group to perform on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to welcome the new year and made their Japanese TV music show debut on TV Asahi ' s Japan Music Station Super Live . At the end of the year, BTS won their second Artist of the Year at the 19th Mnet Asian Music Awards , becoming the first act to win the award two years in a row. They also became the first artist outside of the \"Big Three\" to win major awards at the Golden Disc Awards and the Seoul Music Awards , respectively. In the lead up to their next album, BTS released an original eight-episode documentary series exclusively on YouTube Premium entitled Burn the Stage that ran from March until May 2018, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the group's 2017 Wings Tour. In April, the group also released their third Japanese studio album, Face Yourself , which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard 200 as the third-highest-charting Japanese album in the history of the chart. In conjunction with the release of Face Yourself , the group released a nine-minute short film titled \"Euphoria: Theme of Love Yourself: Wonder ,\" which featured the song \"Euphoria\" and embodied the \"起\" or \"beginning\" of the narrative sequence. In May 2018, BTS released their third Korean-language studio album, Love Yourself: Tear in conjunction with an appearance at the 25th Billboard Music Awards . At the show, BTS debuted as performers with the premiere of their lead single, \" Fake Love \" and won Top Social Artist , making them the only Korean artist to win the award two years in a row. In the narrative sequence, the album coincided with the \"轉\" or \"turn\" of the series, touching on the tortuous enlightenment of loving without being loved and encouragement to those without dreams. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Caitlin Kelley from Billboard described the album as \"one of their most thematically cohesive yet sonically varied albums, with maximalist production erupting against lyrics about emptiness,\" while Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork wrote that the album \"formula is a slick, loosely thematic album about love and loss, with a stronger focus on rapping than ever before\" and that it \"aims for cohesion and produces fun, prismatic songs in the process.\" Commercially, Love Yourself: Tear was one of BTS' most successful albums, bringing them to new heights both domestically and internationally. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with 135,000 album-equivalent units (including 100,000 pure album sales), becoming BTS' highest-charting and first number one album in the US, the first K-pop album to top the U.S. albums chart, and the highest-charting album by an Asian act. Love Yourself: Tear also became BTS' first top ten hit in the United Kingdom , reaching number eight on the UK Albums Chart . Their single \"Fake Love\" became their first top ten hit at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the seventeenth non-English song to reach the top ten and the first by a Korean group. \"Fake Love\" later became their third single to attain Gold certification by the RIAA that August. In South Korea, Love Yourself: Tear sold over 1.6 million copies in its first two weeks, making it the highest monthly sales for an album since the Gaon Chart's inception at that time. As the conclusion of the Love Yourself series, BTS released their second Korean compilation album Love Yourself: Answer in August 2018, which contained songs from the previous Love Yourself releases along with seven additional new tracks. The album was supported by the lead single \" Idol \" and the alternative digital release featuring Nicki Minaj . Thematically, Love Yourself: Answer placed the songs of the Love Yourself series within the narrative of beginning, development, turn and conclusion to illustrate the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of self-love. Critically, the album received generally positive reviews, with Billboard calling it a \"masterful culmination of years of work and rife with meaning\" and \"undeniably a magnum opus from BTS that that few other artists, boy bands or otherwise, ever can hope to achieve.\" Commercially, the record sold over 1.9 million copies on the Gaon Album Chart in August 2018, breaking the chart's all-time monthly record once again. The album became BTS' second number-one album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and their highest sales week in the country at that time, making BTS the only K-pop act with two Billboard 200 toppers and the first pop act with two number one albums in less than a year since One Direction topped the chart with Midnight Memories in 2013 and Four in 2014. Love Yourself: Answer later became the first Korean language album to be certified Gold by the RIAA in November. In Canada, Love Yourself: Answer became the band's first number-one album on the Canadian Albums Chart . In the United States, \"Idol\" peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 . The single \"Idol\" also reached number five on the Canadian Singles Chart , marking BTS' first top-ten hit in Canada. The music video for \"Idol\" received over 45 million views in its first 24 hours on YouTube, breaking the record previously set by Taylor Swift with \" Look What You Made Me Do \". \"Idol\" and Love Yourself: Answer later received platinum certifications, both selling more than one million certified units in the United States. \"Idol\" became the group's third Platinum single while Answer became the group's first Platinum album, making BTS the first Korean artist to attain this certification in the US. In conjunction with Love Yourself: Answer ' s release in August 2018, BTS commenced their third world tour, BTS World Tour: Love Yourself , with a landmark concert in the Seoul Olympic Stadium , the largest stadium in South Korea. During their tour, BTS also featured on Steve Aoki 's single \" Waste It On Me \" released that October, which was their first and only all-English language feature. On tour, BTS continued to play to progressively larger venues from arenas to domes to stadiums. For the final stop of the North American leg, the band performed at Citi Field in Queens , marking the first time a Korean act has performed at a U.S. stadium. All 40,000 tickets for the stadium date sold out in under 20 minutes. According to StubHub BTS was one of 2018's best-selling concerts in international markets outside the US, second to only Ed Sheeran . Vivid Seats named BTS the 2018 artist of the year, citing the group's history-making concert at Citi Field. The tour also received generally positive reviews from critics. Philip Cosores from Uproxx described BTS' four nights at the Staples Center as an \"enormous, multi-sensory experience\" bringing an \"inclusive\" and \"multicultural experience\" where music is above any language barrier, while Crystal Bell from MTV said \"BTS have created an experience so captivating, so inclusive, and so visually stunning that it’s cemented the boy band as one of the most vital acts in pop music today.\" That October, with more than a year remaining in their contract, BTS renewed their contract with Big Hit Entertainment through 2026. In early November 2018, a popular Japanese music show cancelled BTS' performance citing a T-shirt a member wore the year before. In the same month the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) stated BTS owed victims an apology for the shirt in 2017, clothing with Nazi symbolism, and a flag. Big Hit Entertainment issued an apology, saying that the images on the clothing were not intended to be hurtful to the victims of Nazism or atomic bombings, and that the band and management would take steps to prevent future mistakes. They also stated the flags were meant to be a commentary on the Korean school system. The apology was accepted by SWC and the Korean Atomic Bomb Victim Association. Crossing over to film, BTS released Burn the Stage: The Movie in theaters worldwide in November 2018 to commercial success. In the United States it accumulated $1.2 million on opening day for a total of $3.54 million over the three day weekend, breaking the record for the highest grossing event cinema musical production which was previously set in 2014 by the band One Direction. It ranked at number ten in the box office despite selling at only 620 locations compared to the 2,000-4,000 locations for the other top ten sellers. At the end of the year, BTS won their third Artist of the Year at the 20th Mnet Asian Music Awards in a row and ranked number eight on Billboard's year-end Top Artist Chart alongside the likes of Drake and Taylor Swift and were also the number two act of the year in the Duo/Group ranking, only behind Imagine Dragons . They also made the Bloomberg 50 due to their \"willingness to address social issues, mental health, and politics, despite being in a genre often painted as bubble gum pop\". The group sold more than ten millions albums in South Korea alone, with five million being sold in 2018 alone. In February 2019, BTS attended the 61st Grammy Awards as award presenters. It was their first time attending the event following an appearance by the group at the LA Grammy Museum in 2018. In April, BTS became the first Asian act to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify , and Time named them as one of Time 100 's most influential people of 2019. Their sixth EP, Map of the Soul: Persona , was released on April 12 with the lead single \" Boy With Luv \" (Korean: 작은 것들을 위한 시; RR: Jageun geotdeureul wihan si ), featuring American singer Halsey . The EP's release was followed by a performance on Saturday Night Live , as the first Korean act to do so. The group's appearance was anticipated as one of the biggest in the show's history.

BTS co-writes, produces, and composes much of their output. Since their inception, BTS have developed and maintained a style of \"fusion music\" with an emphasis on hip hop as their musical base largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as underground rappers and their main producer Pdogg. Rather than wanting to stick to a specific genre, BTS have introduced brand new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album. BTS' sound began with old-school hip hop influences heard on 2 Cool 4 Skool and O!RUL8,2? , but evolved to include R&B and rock with Skool Luv Affair and Dark and Wild , orchestral strings and electronic dance music with their The Most Beautiful Moment in Life album series, moombahton , neo soul , and gospel in Wings and You Never Walk Alone , future bass , Latin pop , and jazz hip hop in their Love Yourself album series and emo rap , rap-rock , Afro pop , nu-disco , funk , trap and pop-rap in their Map of the Soul album series. BTS' lyrics include social commentary , often incorporating criticism of South Korean society. Songs such as \" No More Dream \" and \" N.O \" from their \"school trilogy\" were motivated by their experiences with South Korea's emphasis on education and called for change to the education system and societal expectations. Their experiences with youth culture in South Korea inspired songs like \" Dope \" and \" Silver Spoon \" (Korean: 뱁새; RR: Baepsae ) from their \"youth series,\" referencing generational disparity and the millennial 's giving up of romantic relationships, marriage, children, proper employment, homes, and social life in the face of economic difficulties and societal ills while facing condemnation from the media and older generations. The song \" Am I Wrong \" from Wings (2016) questioned societal apathy towards the state of current events—the lyric \"We're all dogs and pigs / we become dogs because we're angry\" referenced the South Korean Ministry of Education official Na Hyang-wook who was a proponent of the caste system and described the average person as \"dogs and pigs,\" and BTS performed the song on television during the 2016 South Korean political scandal that led to the impeachment of ex-President Park Geun-hye . RM and Suga's personal struggles with mental health inspired songs like \" Tomorrow \", \" Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life \", \"So Far Away\", \"The Last\", and \" Forever Rain .\" \" Not Today \" from You Never Walk Alone (2017) is an anti-establishment anthem, with messages advocating for minority groups, while \" Spring Day \" was created to memorialize the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy . BTS' albums have recurring themes that fall under the overarching theme of \"reflection of youth.\" Their \"school trilogy\" explored \"the troubles and anxieties of school-age youth.\" Their \"youth series\" \"tackled a subject that the vast majority of youth experience, but few pop musicians articulate well: mental health and the desire to belong in society.\" Wings (2016) focused on temptation and sin. The \"Love Yourself\" series utilized a narrative form to illustrate the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of self-love. Since their inception, BTS have held the belief that telling their story is the only way for the younger generation to relate to their music. Writing over 90 percent of their lyrics, BTS try to include experiences everyone has felt in life, such as sadness and loneliness, and turn them to something more light and manageable. In regards to their lyricism, RM states he tries to not sound as if they're preaching or reprimanding people in their songs as everyone has different lives and different destinies. When asked if it is difficult to write about things like mental health, Suga responded, BTS has been praised for \"speak[ing] honestly about topics they deem important, even in a conservative society\" by Jeff Benjamin in Fuse magazine . South Korean president Moon Jae-in , in a letter to BTS, recognized their sincerity and inclusion of diversity as key to their success, writing, \"Each of the seven members sings in a way that is true to himself and the life he wants to live. Their melody and lyrics transcend regional borders, language, culture, and institutions.\" BTS have been described as \"easily the biggest and most successful name in K-pop in the world\" that can \"do things no other name in their genre can\", with Time giving them the nickname \"Princes of Pop\". Billboard Senior Vice President Silvio Pietroluongo said that BTS are comparable and as influential to the Beatles and The Monkees . Nielsen Music Vice President Helena Kosinski says that \"although BTS weren't the first to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They don't just appeal to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic.\" As the first non-English speaking artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming platforms, coming second only to Drake . In 2019, BTS were again named as one of the top 10 Global Recording Artists of the year by IFPI , for a second time, ranking #7. They were the only non-English speaking act on that list. In the United States, BTS accounted for 72.7 percent of the album consumption units generated by K-pop acts in 2018 out of a total of 17 acts. In South Korea, BTS accounted for 41.9 percent of album sales in the first half of 2019, up from their market share of 25.3 percent the previous year. In November 2019, Billboard ranked BTS at #4 on their Top Social Artist of the 2010s list, making them the highest group on the list. BTS was also ranked #45 on Billboard' s Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list. They are the highest-ranked Asian act on the list as well as the only non-English speaking act. BTS have been often regarded as \" the biggest boy band in the world \". They have also appeared in various power listings. The most tweeted-about celebrities in the world in 2017 and 2018, the band was included in Time 's list of the 25 most influential people on the internet from 2017 to 2019, featured on the magazine's October 2018 international edition cover as \"Next Generation Leaders,\" and were listed as one of Time 100 's most influential people in 2019. The group was also listed as one of the most influential artists of the decade by CNN , for \"popularizing K-pop in the US\". According to a JoyNews24 'Power People of 2019' survey among industry professionals, BTS was chosen as #1 with 74 votes, with #2 being Parasite Director Bong Joon-ho with 29 votes. BTS also appeared in Bloomberg Market ' s 50 most influential in 2018, and Forbes Korea named them the fifth most influential celebrities of Korea in 2017, and the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018. In 2019, BTS ranked 43rd on Forbes ' annual list of the 100 highest-paid celebrities with earnings of $57 million. BTS also ranked first on the list of 'Top Rank Global Sustainable Future Leaders' during an announcement from the UN-sponsored SDG association at the United Nations headquarters, while BTS' fanclub, ARMY, were noted as the 'Top Rank Sustainable Global group'. Other notable people included in this list were Malala Yousafzai and Bill Gates . In California , BTS inspired a teacher to have his school be the first in the country to offer a Korean American Culture and Society course. Kang Soojung, exhibition manager at the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, said that while preparing the 50th anniversary exhibition called “Square,” she was greatly influenced by BTS's hidden track “Sea\". The group's influence has led them to address the United Nations at their 73rd General Assembly and to perform before 400 officials including South Korean president Moon Jae-in at the 2018 Korea-France Friendship Concert in Paris , a summit meant to show the friendly relations between France and South Korea. Moon Hee-sang , Speaker of the National Assembly, said that \"BTS is doing most of our work,” attributing the results of his overseas trip to the credit of the global group on an overseas trip to promote “sales diplomacy\". In September 2019, president Moon Jae-in also mentioned BTS in his announcement for his '3 major innovation strategies for the contents industry', stating that BTS has pioneered innovative business models that communicate directly with fans. In October 2019, The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism selected BTS as a recipient for a 'Letter of Appreciation', for showing the world the beauty of Korean traditional culture (Hangul, Hanbok, Gugak) through creative re-interpretations in their music. In December 2019, according to the annual survey conducted by Gallup Korea, BTS were the most preferred artists of 2019 for a second consecutive year. According to the \"2019 South Korean National Image\" survey conducted by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and its affiliate the Korean Culture and Information Service among 16 countries, BTS were chosen #2 with 5.5% votes. Despite cultural medals traditionally being given to recipients with more than 15 years of notable achievements, BTS became the youngest ever recipients honored with the Order of Cultural Merit by the President of South Korea in 2018 after five years after debuting, due to their noteworthy contributions in spreading Korean culture and language. BTS have measurably revitalized the Korean economy and the global music industry. Credited for the surge in popularity of online purchases of K-pop items and the growth of the Korean Wave between 2016 and 2018 by the Korea Customs Service and Korea Foundation , BTS were cited as one of the main driving forces for the recovery of South Korea's music-related sector to levels seen before China's 2016 ban on domestic cultural contents over soured diplomatic relations. Yung Duk Kim, vice president and chief operating officer of the Korea Creative Content Agency , stated K-pop has “skyrocketed” since BTS' popularity surged, creating jobs not only for BTS and their team but other K-pop idols as well. Various news outlets coined the term the \"BTS effect\" to refer to the commercial effects of BTS' influence, such as when KB Kookmin Bank savings accounts increased six-fold compared to the prior year following BTS' endorsement and when stock prices of entertainment companies in South Korea shot up for five days after BTS topped the U.S. Billboard 200 . The effect was also observed when companies tied to BTS, such as Netmarble , NetMark, Soribada , Key Shares, GMP, Diffie, and Mattel had their stocks rise. In October 2019, Mattel 's international gross sales rose 10% to $721.7 million, lifted by sales of dolls based on BTS. Data firm SM2 Networks estimated Hyundai Motor received ₩600 billion ($502 million) in promotional results after commissioning BTS as their promotional models in 2018. The Bank of Korea Economic Statistics System stated that South Korea's BOP for music and entertainment reached $114.7 million in the first quarter of 2019, attributing this to an improved relationship between China and South Korea, and the breakout global success of BTS, particularly in North America. Signed on as tourism ambassadors in 2017, the Seoul Metropolitan Government credits BTS for the recovery of Seoul's shrinking tourism industry following the 2016 THAAD controversy , bringing in an average of 790,000 tourists to Korea annually. In December 2018, the Hyundai Research Institute estimated that BTS were worth more than $3.67 billion to the Korean economy each year, attracting one in every thirteen foreigners who visited Korea. BTS' two day fan-meetings held in Seoul and Busan in June 2019 generated a total economic effect of ₩481 billion ($408 million) to both cities, accounting for 1.6% of Busan's 2018 GDP , and 0.9% of Seoul's 2018 GDP. Their three-day concert finale in Seoul for their Love Yourself World Tour in October 2019 was estimated to have an economic value of almost ₩1 trillion ($862 million) and brought in 187,000 foreign visitors to South Korea. As of June 2019 [update] , BTS' economic effect on South Korea is estimated to be over ₩5.5 trillion ($4.65 billion) per year, about 0.3% of South Korea's GDP. This is comparable to Korean Air , the flagship airline of South Korea, who's percent contribution to South Korea's GDP is 0.7%. The 2019 annual ticket sales data released by the Korean online ticketing site, Interpark revealed that BTS' world tour \"Love Yourself: Speak Yourself\" concert at the Seoul Olympic Stadium ranked No.1, with BTS topping the ticket sales for the second consecutive year on Interpark. Outside of South Korea, BTS' concerts at Wembley Stadium were estimated to have brought around ₩100 billion ($82 million) as a direct economic effect to the city of London . After BTS went to Malta for their show, 'Bon Voyage 3', the Malta Tourism Authority reported a 237% increase of Korean tourists visiting the country, crediting BTS as the reason for the increase. Along with Ariana Grande and Drake , BTS were credited as a key act boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018. Such profit had not been seen since 2006 after digital purchases gained momentum. BTS' work has influenced numerous artists, including (G)I-dle , D-Crunch 's Hyunho, The Boyz' Younghoon and Hwall, SF9's Zuho, Euna Kim , Golden Child's Jaehyun, Wanna One , IN2IT , Park Ji-hoon , Kim Dong-han , Seven O'Clock , Hyeongseop X Euiwoong , Noir , Victon 's Sejun and Byungchan, and Loona . After BTS released their single \" Idol ,\" the National Gugak Center had to expand the amount of Korean instrument sounds available due to increased demand from Korean and foreign producers alike. K-pop idol groups also began changing the themes of their lyrics from love stories to words such as \"looking for myself\" following BTS' \"Love Yourself\" era and RM 's speech at the United Nations . BTS has received many awards and honors, including 24 Mnet Asian Music Awards , 23 Melon Music Awards , 20 Golden Disc Awards , 14 Seoul Music Awards , 13 Gaon Chart Music Awards , 4 Billboard Music Awards , 4 Korean Music Awards , 4 American Music Awards , and 2 MTV Video Music Awards .

The BTS Universe, also known as the Bangtan Universe or BU, is an alternate universe created by Big Hit Entertainment that winds through the group's output. The webtoon Save Me closely follows the story line, along with their book HYYH: The Notes 1 . The chronology of the universe began with the song \" I Need U \" and spans to the present time. It tells the story of the seven members in an alternate reality and depicts their anxieties and uncertainties as they confront their futures. In a corporate briefing held on February 4, 2020, Big Hit also announced the upcoming release of its sequel HYYH: The Notes 2 , the recreation of five BTS songs into five picture books , and an upcoming drama to be produced in collaboration with Chorokbaem Media and renowned screenwriter Kim Soo-jin. Speaking to Billboard , Michelle Cho, an assistant professor of East Asian Popular Cultures at the University of Toronto, said \"As an audio-visual experience, \"I Need U\" inaugurated the Bangtan Universe—the coming-of-age storyline that brilliantly integrates the Most Beautiful Moment in Life [album] trilogy and continues in music videos, \"concept videos\" (mini-films), and the multiform, open-ended narrative that's been serialized in album liner notes and Twitter and Instagram posts.\" Mariejo Ramos from The Inquirer said about the universe \"no other artists have successfully mixed the same literary technique to pop music in such a scale.\" They used the alternate universe and literary books, such as The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas , as a framing device for their albums. Mixing the two has created an interactive environment for their fans who make theories when new material or hints are released. On March 22, 2020, Big Hit Entertainment announced the launch of a video series, \"Learn Korean With BTS\", on social media app Weverse , intended to “make it easy and fun for global fans who have difficulty enjoying BTS' music and contents due to the language barrier.” The idea for the project emerged in reaction to fans asking for English subtitles for BTS's videos. The series consists of thirty three-minute lessons on Korean expressions and grammar using footage from existing BTS content on Youtube and VLive, such as \"Run BTS!\" and \"Bangtan Bomb.\" The videos were developed in collaboration with experts at the Korean Language Content Institute and Hankuk University of Foreign Studies . Big Hit Entertainment stated its intent to develop more educational programs with other artists on its labels. The first three episodes were released on March 24, with subsequent videos posted weekly on Mondays. " ;

    dbo:abstract " Berry Good ( Korean : 베리굿 ; RR : Beri Gut ) is a South Korean girl group formed by Asia Bridge Entertainment in 2014. The group's current line-up consists of Johyun, Seoyul, Daye, Sehyung and Gowoon. They released their debut single Love Letter in May 2014. Berry Good debuted on May 21, 2014, with the music video for \" Love Letter \", a remake of the song released by Click-B in 2000. The eponymous single was released the following day, when they also started promotions on M! Countdown . In January 2015, Asia Bridge Entertainment stated that Subin, Iera and Nayeon had left the group to concentrate on their studies, and introduced new member Seoyul, followed by Daye and Sehyung. Their second single Because of You was released on February 9. They started promotions on February 10 on SBS MTV 's The Show . In June, their representative office launched various Berry Good goods (such as accessories, clothes and cosmetics) in China. On September 23, their third single My First Love was released. Two music videos were produced, one of which features actress Kim Bo-ra . The song, posthumous work of composer Joo Tae-young, was first performed in advance on September 20 at Hallyu Dream Concert, and promotions started on September 22 on The Show . On March 11, Berry Good launched a crowdfunding campaign to produce their first EP on Makestar. The ₩10-million goal was reached in ten days and the campaign ultimately raised ₩16,084,438, 160.8% of its original goal. On April 20, the crowdfunded mini-album Very Berry , led by title track \"Angel\", was released. Their following release was crowdfunded on Makestar as well. The project started on September 1 as a new single, but it was later upgraded to a mini album, and ended raising ₩26,896,790, 268.97% of its original 10-million goal. The group also added a sixth member, Johyun. Three out of four songs from the EP, including the lead track \"Don't Believe\", were showcased on Arirang Radio 's K-poppin' one day before their release. The official music video for \"Don't Believe\", and the group's second mini album Glory , were released on November 1. A third Makestar project was launched on March 9, 2017 to finance their sixth digital single Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo . While the song was released on April 16, its music video was uploaded to the group's YouTube channel the day after. To promote Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo , Berry Good adopted a \"part-timer concept\", experiencing part-time works between schedules and sending proceeds to the needy. On June 9, they performed three songs at the Thống Nhất Stadium of Ho Chi Minh City , Vietnam . Taeha, Sehyung and Gowoon debuted in the group's first sub-unit, Berry Good Heart Heart, on April 27, 2018, releasing their first single Crazy, Gone Crazy . On August 16, the group made a comeback with their first full album Free Travel , that they had been recording since August 2017. They commemorated the release through a showcase held that afternoon at Ilji Art Hall in Cheongdam-dong . After promoting the lead single \"Green Apple\", in September they went on with B-side \"Mellow Mellow\", but Sehyung sat out due to an ankle fracture; despite participating in their single This Winter , released on December 15, she was on hiatus until March 1st, 2019. On October 18, 2018, Berry Good held their first concert in Japan, at Shinjuku Blaze in Tokyo. They released their third mini-album, Fantastic , on May 25, 2019 as a five-member group, with Daye resting due to health issues. They started comeback promotions that same day on Show! Music Core , but, two days later, Taeha announced her contract had expired and she would no longer be in the group. Berry Good therefore discontinued the album's promotional activities. Berry Good doesn't have a fixed basic image, but they change it for every release. They started their career with dance tracks, before releasing their first ballad \"My First Love\" in September 2015. To promote \"Don't Believe\" in November 2016, Berry Good underwent a change of styling and concept to take off the original girlish, neat and pure image, adding EDM and tropical house elements to their music.

fadm:Blady a schema:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Blady" ;
    dbo:abstract "Blady ( Korean : 블레이디 ) was a five-member South Korean girl group originally formed by SY6 Entertainment and later produced by Star Planet. The group debuted on May 16, 2011, with a retro-inspired single \"찌릿찌릿 (Spark Spark). In 2011, Blady made its debut originally with four members: Darae, Bunhong, Sunyeong and Kangyoon. The group released their debut song, the retro inspired single \"찌릿찌릿 (Spark Spark)\", on May 16, 2011. As early rookies they received praises from hit composer Shinsadong Tiger , who's known for producing for Beast and 4minute , as he saw in their training process that their \"passion and skills\" stood above many other girl groups debuting at the time. He went on to say, \"In anticipation for their debut, the members have been sleeping three hours a night in order to devote everything else to their rehearsals.\" A follow up single titled \"미친 날 (Crazy Day)\" was released on July 27, 2011. The music video for \"Crazy Day\" was shot in 3D in the Maldives by director Kang Young Man . The clip also featured dance moves choreographed by Main Spirit who has also worked with Lee Hyori and Bada . At the end of their debuting year, the girls took home the 2011 19th Republic of Korea Culture Entertainment Awards Idol Music Rookie of the Year award. Also, SY6 added a new member, Nahyun. Despite rumors of disbandment in 2012 and early 2013, Blady released a single \"B형 여자 (Blood Type B Girl)\" on November 18, 2013. The group returned with five members, Kangyoon being the only first generation member to return. Thus, she was promoted to leader status in the group. This comeback saw the addition of new members Coco, Tina, Yeji and Soojin. [ citation needed ] The single release of \"B형 여자 (Blood Type B Girl)\" also saw a new remixed version of \"미친 날 (Crazy Day)\" titled \"Bring Bring\" with a stronger hip hop and rock flavor than its predecessor. \"B형 여자 (Blood Type B Girl)\" is a collaboration between renowned producer C-Luv (who has produced for Rain , MBLAQ and Kim Hyun Joong ) and songwriter Stay Tuned. The song features a funky urban electronic beat and draws inspiration from the fact that all the members of Blady have blood type B. Blady Soul was the first special unit to come from Blady, consisting of members Yeji and Soojin. The duo released a digital single, \"떠나가지마 (Please Don't Leave Me)\", to commemorate White Day . The song garnered attention for its smooth R&B style in contrast to Blady's normal bubblegum-pop style. In late 2014, it was revealed that members Coco, Kangyoon, and Yeji had left the group. [ citation needed ] In March 2015, it was revealed that member Soojin had also left Blady. [ citation needed ] Not long after, Star Planet announced that the group would be making another comeback as a five-member group. Along with Tina, there would be four new members, Giru, Dayeong, Yeeun, and Gabin, added to Blady's lineup. [ citation needed ] A showcase was held on March 9, 2015 in Seoul to kick off promotions for their mini album 'Renovation'. [ citation needed ] On March 30, 2015, Blady released their music video for \"Come to Me\", the title track for Renovation, featuring the new lineup. On July 27, 2015, Blady released a special summer single entitled \"Secret Number(비밀열쇠)\". The first version of the music video was released the same day on both Blady's and 1THEK's official YouTube channels, and the second version was released on October 19 of the same year. Blady began promotions for \"Secret Number(비밀열쇠)\" the following week the song was released. On October 20, 2017, the members all made farewell posts on Instagram, saying the group had disbanded.

fadm:Block_B a schema:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Block_B" ;
    dbo:abstract "Block B ( Korean : 블락비 ) is a South Korean boy band created by Cho PD in 2011. The group debuted with seven members: Taeil , B-Bomb , Jaehyo , U-Kwon , Park Kyung , Zico , and P.O . In February 2011, Cho PD announced that he would be spending $1.4 million USD to create a seven-member hip hop group under his \"Creating Korea's Eminem Project\". On April 13, 2011, their debut music video for \"Freeze!\" was released, but banned by the Commission of Youth Protection because they felt that it was too sexy for Korean television. As a result, the song could not be sold to minors under the age of 19, and the video could not be aired before 10 pm. On April 15, 2011, Block B made their live debut on KBS Music Bank . The group followed up with another track, \"Wanna B\". A mini album, New Kids on the Block , was released on June 23, 2011. On June 22, 2011, the first episode of MTV's eight-episode series Match Up! was aired featuring Block B and B1A4 . On October 16, 2011 MTV started airing a series of specials for the Match Up series that followed Block B as they promoted in Japan. Welcome to the Block , their second mini album, ran into some controversy: two songs from the album were banned as inappropriate for minors by The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (MOGEF) and KBS. In February 2012, Block B came under fire for behaving inappropriately during an interview that had taken place in Thailand a month earlier. They made offensive remarks regarding the flood disaster that was taking place and were criticized by other celebrities and the media. In response, the members issued letters of apology and released a video on their record company's YouTube channel. As result of this incident, leader of Block B, Zico, also shaved his head to demonstrate his remorse. Block B returned in October 2012 with their first full-length album, Blockbuster . The title track \"Nillili Mambo\" was well received and ranked number 10 on Billboard' s World Albums Chart. On January 3, it was reported that Block B had filed a suit against their agency to ask for their exclusive contract to be nullified. According to media reports, the Block B members filed against Stardom at the Seoul Central District Court, stating, \"During the signing of the exclusive contract, it was promised that in addition to providing proper training opportunity and facilities, we would be paid on every 25th of the following month…However, the agency has not paid us for nearly one year since April 2011.\" (It's not clear whether it is 2011 or 2012 since the quote in the article states that it is nearly a year, but April 2011 would be well over a year). \"It started last year in March when one member's contract was ended and his portion of the pay was calculated… Appearance fees from events as well as pay from SBS drama 'Phantom's OST, MBC drama 'Golden Time' OST, and funds collected from the inauguration of our Japanese fan site's fan club, and more for a total of 10 things, have been omitted.\" They added, \"The CEO of the agency, Mr. Lee, has also disappeared with the 70,000,000 KRW (~66,000 USD) that he collected from the members' parents.\" On May 20, 2013, it was reported that Mr. Lee had committed suicide. On June 7, 2013, the court ruled in favour of the company, saying \"It's difficult to see the company not being able to pay the group as intentional. From the evidence provided so far, it is difficult to claim that the label purposely did not pay Block B. It is also difficult to say that the label did not provide proper facilities such as studios and dorms, and it is also difficult to say that they did not provide education and guidance. From written records, it cannot be said that Stardom Entertainment violated their management obligations. There is a possibility that the musical income of 430,000,000 KRW (approximately $385,000 USD) and the event income of 5,000,000 KRW (approximately $4,500 USD) was not properly taken care of. However, from just the evidence provided, it cannot be said that the label purposely kept the money from the members.\" Block B issued a statement in response to the ruling, apologising to fans and saying they would no longer be working with Stardom Entertainment. The group also said that they would be contesting the ruling, and were preparing independent promotions. On August 29, 2013, Block B announced that they had negotiated the transfer of their rights from Stardom to a new management company, Seven Seasons. A representative from Seven Seasons said that the group was planning to release a new album in October. Seven Seasons created a YouTube channel on which they uploaded Block B videos. On August 31, 2013, Seven Seasons released U-Kwon's teaser video, which featured him jogging through urban Seoul, with the question \"Do you wanna B?\" at the end. Following that was Jaehyo and P.O 's teaser released on September 4, showing the two suiting up. That teaser also ended with the question: \"Do you wanna B?\" On September 17, 2013, Block B announced their pre-released single via Seven Seasons' YouTube channel. The single \"Be the Light\" featured Taeil's singing voice with a short clip of their music video accompanying it. The full video was released September 22, 2013. The song reached #14 on the Gaon digital chart in the first week of its release. Block B released their next mini-album, Very Good , with five songs, on October 2. The group also released a video of the title song, along with a \"Maximum Close Up Version\" on October 7 and a \"Dance Like BB Version\" on October 15. They held a comeback showcase October 3 at Korea University Hwajeong Gym in Seoul. Very Good debuted at number one on the Gaon album chart, while the singles \"Very Good\", \"When Where What How\", and \"Nice Day\" debuted at number six, 20, and 26, respectively, on the Gaon digital single chart. The album also debuted at number six on the Billboard world album chart. Block B starred in their own reality show, entitled Five Minutes Before Chaos (개판5분전) , which premiered April 10 on Mnet. In early April, Block B announced that they would release a new album entitled Jackpot . The video for the album's title track, \"Jackpot\", was released on April 15, while the album itself was scheduled to be released on April 17. Although the physical album was released, the group's comeback was canceled following the capsizing of a South Korean ferry carrying more than 400 people. Block B held their first Korean concert series, 2014 Blockbuster, in May, selling out Olympic Park’s Olympic Hall on the first day of pre-sales. The series was held on May 17 and 18 in Seoul, and May 23 and 24 in Busan. Block B presented showcases in New York, Miami, and Washington D.C. in June through the concert organizer Jazzy Group. On July 11, Seven Seasons announced that Block B would release a new mini-album, entitled H.E.R , on July 24. Six days later, Seven Seasons released Jackpot digitally for the first time as part of the lead-up to the release of H.E.R , as well as a behind-the-scenes of the \"Jackpot\" video. \"Jackpot\" ranked number ten on the Gaon digital singles chart the first week of its release. \"H.E.R\" was released on July 24 with an accompanying music video. The song debuted at number three on the Gaon digital singles chart, while the singles \"Jackpot\", \"Extraordinary Woman\", \"Hold Me Now\", and \"Very Good (Rough Ver.)\" debuted at numbers five, 16, 28, and 80, respectively. The album debuted at number six on the Billboard World Albums chart and number two on the Gaon album chart. On November 22 and 23, Block B held an encore solo Korean concert series, 2014 Blockbuster Remastering, which attracted more than 10,000 fans to two shows at Seoul's SK Olympic Handball Gymnasium. Block B made its official Japanese debut on January 21, 2015, with the release of the single \"Very Good (Japanese Version)\". The single debuted at number five on the Oricon weekly chart and number seven on the Billboard Japan Hot 100. The CD release followed a pair of concerts in Tokyo on January 16 and 17 that attracted more than 5,000 fans. The group had its first official fan meeting on February 15, 2015, attracting approximately 8,000 fans to Seoul's SK Olympic Handball Gymnasium. Block B conducted their first European tour in February and March 2015, visiting Paris on February 27, Helsinki on March 1, Warsaw on March 6, and Milan on March 8. The tour sold out most shows. On March 27, Taeil released the solo track \"Shaking\" (also called \"Inspiring\"), which describes the angst of being around the one you secretly love. The song's release was accompanied by a music video starring actress Nam Ji-hyun . Because the story is told from singer's first-person perspective, Taeil does not physically appear in the video. On April 5 and 6, Block B announced through solo teaser photos that P.O, U-Kwon, and B-Bomb would make up the group's first sub-unit called Bastarz . The sub-unit's album was released April 13, along with a video for the title track, \"Conduct Zero\". The album debuted at number three on the Gaon album chart. To promote the sub-unit, B-Bomb and U-Kwon co-starred in a webdrama entitled Jumping Girl with f(x) 's Luna and Secret 's Hana. Block B's official Japanese Web site announced May 1 that the group would release its second single in the country, the Japanese version of \"H.E.R\", on May 27. Block B began a tour of Japan on May 14; although originally four concerts were scheduled, due to strong demand for tickets the tour was expanded to seven concerts, with performances in Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Nagoya drawing some 20,000 fans. The single \"H.E.R\" debuted at number seven on the weekly Oricon chart. On August 2, Block B performed at the Los Angeles KCON . The Los Angeles Times reported that \"Block B had one of the most successful melds of Korean hip-hop with boy-band dynamics to come of the scene.\" Park Kyung released a solo track September 21 called \"Ordinary Love\", featuring Park Bo-ram . The track was produced by Park Kyung in collaboration with Kero One . \"Ordinary Love\" debuted at number 3 on the Gaon digital chart. On September 23, it was announced that Block B would tour the United States for a second time in a concert series organized by SubKulture Entertainment. The group performed in San Francisco November 11, the Chicago area November 13, and Los Angeles November 15. On March 26, shortly before the release of their lead single, the entire group appeared as guests on the television show Saturday Night Live Korea . The episode included a skit about fan fiction in which Park Kyung and Zico fell in love and kissed each other on the mouth. The kiss resulted in the show being sanctioned by the Korea Communications Standards Commission , which ruled that the skit promoted homosexuality to minors. Block B released the single \"A Few Years Later\" two days after their Saturday Night Live Korea appearance, and it debuted at number three on the Gaon digital chart. Blooming Period debuted at number one on the Gaon album chart, with the singles \"Toy\", \"Walkin' in the Rain\", \"It Was Love\" (Taeil version), and \"Bingle Bingle\" debuting on the Gaon digital chart at numbers two, 16, 17, and 52, respectively. Block B released two singles in Japan in 2016, \"Jackpot\" and \"Toy\", In late September, it was announced that the group would release My Zone , their first Japanese album, on October 26.

On December 15, 2016, the concert organizer My Music Taste announced that Block B would have a European tour in February and March 2017. The cities on the tour include Amsterdam, Helsinki, Lisbon, Budapest, and London. On February 6, 2017, Block B released the digital single \"Yesterday\".

From February 24, 2017, till March 5, 2017, Block B held their second European Tour called Block B 2017 LIVE BLOCKBUSTER IN EUROPE!

    rdfs:label "Brown_Eyed_Girls" ;
    dbo:abstract " The Brown Eyed Girls (Hangul: 브라운 아이드 걸스, Japanese: ブラウン・アイド・ガールズ), often abbreviated as B.E.G. , BG , or 브아걸 (beu-ah-geol), is a South Korean girl group with four members: JeA , Miryo , Narsha , and Gain . They debuted as an R&B/Ballad vocal group with \"Come Closer (다가와서)\" in 2006 and have since performed in a variety of music genres. They rose to popularity in 2008 with \"L.O.V.E\" and their retro-dance number \"How Come,\" and cemented their position in the K-pop world in 2009 with \" Abracadabra \", with its electronica-based genre, pioneering (albeit controversial) concept, along with its iconic and now globally recognized dance entitled 'The Arrogant Dance (시건방춤)'—successfully ingraining themselves into modern popular culture. The group started their venture into the Japanese music market with the release of a Japanese version of their massively successful 3rd Korean album, Sound-G , in late 2010, with full promotions being held throughout early 2011 under Sony Music Japan , where they gained moderate success. They returned to Korea in late 2011, to garner further success and critical acclaim with their 4th album and its title track \"Sixth Sense\". Other than promoting as a group, all of the members have released solo albums. The group's leader, Jea, was the one responsible of the group's creation and was actively involved in the selection of the other members, picking out Miryo, who was known as a capable female rapper from the hip-hop community having previously worked with other fellow rappers, such as Gil Seong-joon from Leessang , and the main female rapper in well-known hip-hop group Honey Family. Narsha was chosen when Jea remembered her as a \"talented singer\" from her high school days, and Ga-in was selected by the three members after she was eliminated from \"Battle Shin Hwa.\" According to Ga-in, she was crying in the bathroom after failing the audition, was found by composer Ahn Jung Hoon, and then was chosen through the audition in Brown Eyed Girls' company. Singer Yoari trained with the group until 2006, when it was decided she would be the lead singer for Sprinkler. The four members held several small size concerts, and considered the names \"Crescendo\" or \"Dark Angel\" before officially debuting as \"Brown Eyed Girls\". After more than 3 years of training in singing and holding several small size concerts, the Brown Eyed Girls released their debut album Your Story in South Korea on March 2, 2006, with the ballad track, \"Come Closer\" as their single. Debuting as a \"faceless group\" they did not appear on any visual media and chose to not even appear in their own music video. The album was well received by critics but did not do as well as expected commercially. The album was later re-released to include \"Hold The Line\" (which samples \" Push The Button \" by British girl band Sugababes and \" Technologic \" by Daft Punk ). This song became a hit, further boosting the band's popularity. \"Hold the Line\" was disclosed across the world because it was included in the list of songs from the game Pump it Up. After a short break, the group went back into the studio to work on their second album Leave Ms. Kim ( 떠나라 미스김 ), which included their R&B title track \"You Got Me Fooled\" ( 너에게 속았다 ). Subsequent singles were \"Oasis\" ( 오아시스 ) featuring Lee Jae Hoon and \"It's Mine\" ( 내꺼야 ), a collaboration with fellow group SeeYa . During the break between their debut and second albums, the Brown Eyed Girls released their first digital single entitled \"I Am a Summer\" ( 내가 여름이다 ), which was later included in their second LP. The first two albums contained typical R&B ballads which had been very popular in the K-pop scene. However, the commercial success was relatively higher in two singles between the first and second albums. Moreover, the second album containing \"You Got Me Fooled\" ( 너에게 속았다 ) was released at nearly the same time as Wonder Girls' \"Tell Me\" which received a nationwide success in Korea. Therefore, their second album was once again a commercial disappointment. At the same time, the general K-pop scene was changing from R&B ballads to dance music. In January 2008, Brown Eyed Girls came back with their first mini-album \"With L.O.V.E.\" Their single, \"L.O.V.E,\" was a departure from the B.E.G. sound that people had come to know but it became an instant success and Brown Eyed Girls scored their first No. 1 song and also one of the top hit songs in the first half of 2008. \"Love Action\" was the second single taken from the mini album. With Love also marked the group's second digital album (after \"I Am a Summer\"), though it was released in conventional CD format as well. After the release of their first mini-album, they could achieve the commercial success. \"Love\" was composed by Saint-Binary and Min-Soo Lee. Looking to strengthen their success, Brown Eyed Girls returned again in September and released their second mini-album \"My Style.\" Title song \"How Come\" is a retro-style dance song that has become a popular trend. On July 20, 2009, Brown Eyed Girls released their third full-length album, the double-disc Sound G . Even though \"Candy Man\" was the first song unveiled from the album, the first heavily promoted single was \" Abracadabra ,\" which was composed by Ji-nu and Min-Soo Lee. He composed the first part of \"Abracadabra,\" and tried to compose the refrain part. However, he could not think of a good idea to make the refrain part. Therefore, Min-Soo Lee, who worked with BEG previously, helped and composed the refrain part of \"Abracadabra.\" The release of this album also saw a shift in the image of the group, as the members redefined themselves as independent and mature city girls. Their music video for their title track sparked controversies. As the group is sporting a substantially more provocative visual style, criticism has arisen for the suggestive and erotic themes that the video presents. They later released a \"stage version\" of the video, which focuses only on the choreography. Nevertheless, even with all the controversies they took the Kpop world by storm, snagging awards at music shows and year end music awards. The sexy hip dance became a national dance with a lot of fellow celebrities doing a parody of it. Later on, the group revealed a repackaged version of the album titled Sign that included a new single, \"Sign,\" along with \"Drunk On Sleep\" and a remix of their previous hit \"Abracadabra.\" The repackaged album was released along with the music video for \"Sign.\" The music video caused controversy because of its content: it featured scenes of violence and death, including the group members drowning in tanks of water. \"Sign\" has reached certain success, but it has not matched the success of the band's previous single \"Abracadabra.\" The quartet has been readying for their Japan debut since signing with major record label Sony Music Japan International. In August 2010, the group re-released Sound G in Japanese to promote them in the country, which indeed marks the beginning of their Japanese promotions. After the success of the album, the members concentrated more on their individual activities juggling it with their overseas schedules. In July, Narsha released her first solo album ' NARSHA ' to meet certain success, In August, JeA collaborated with Rattpoom, a Thai singer, in his song 'Face to Face'. Later in October, Gain also started her solo activities through her debut album Step 2/4 with a strong interpolation of tango music , featuring 'Irreversible' as the title track. [ citation needed ] On October 31, she clutched her first win (Mutizen song) in Inkigayo. In December, JeA worked on her ballad single 'Because You Sting' featuring G.O. of MBLAQ. Aside from that they also became part of popular variety shows and sitcom. Ga-in appeared on We Got Married with 2AM 's Jo Kwon beginning in September 2009. The couple was very popular in Korea and still is one of the most recognized virtual couples in the country. Regrettably, their virtual marriage came to an end after 15 months in January 2011. She made her acting debut in MBC daily sitcom 'All My Love'. She was the female lead 'Gaumji'. However, owing to schedule conflict, her filming in sitcom ended in May 2011. Narsha has appeared on Invincible Youth (also known as G7) since October 2009. She is known on the show as \"Sung In Dol\" (Adult idol) due to her age difference with other members and her funny, but naughty reactions on the show. She was also one of the fixed cast member in SBS's variety show 'Heroes'. In April 2010, she DJed on \"Pump up the Volume\" on KBS Cool FM. Due to Brown Eyed Girls' overseas promotions Narsha decided to leave the show, with her last broadcast on December 28, 2010. The group successfully ended the year with a concert entitled \"Hot Winter Party\" held in the Ax-Korea Hall in Seoul. On January 17, the Japanese music video for \"Sign\" was released. Its content is completely different from the original Korean version of the song, since the new version focuses on choreography while the original version did not feature any. The group started their promotions in Japan in early 2011. The girls originally planned to hold a concert in Japan in April but due to the Tōhoku earthquake in March, the concert was postponed to September instead. The band's first Japanese concert at C.C Lemon Hall in Shibuya took place on September 12. There, they unveiled one of their songs in their fourth album An Inconvenient Truth , which was composed by JeA and KZ. On September 6, NegaNetwork released an official comeback date, marking the end of their two-year hiatus. The group was expected to release a single on September 16 titled, \"Hot Shot,\" followed by their fourth album and music video \"Sixth Sense\" on September 23. [ citation needed ] The concept for this album is “Resistance for freedom of expression through music via sixth sense.” Representatives of their agency, NegaNetwork explained, They kicked off their promotional cycle officially with a double stage performance of \"Hot Shot\" and \"Sixth Sense\" on September 24 on Music Core. and grabbed the top spot on M! Countdown and Inkigayo. They also broke the jinx of going down a slump after a “big hit” as they won over their famed song Abracadabra, receiving higher digital sales for Sixth Sense. They concluded their \"Sixth Sense\" promotions after a month but it was immediately followed by the release of a repackage of their fourth studio album. On November 4, their repackage album was released. They followed up promotions with their ballad song 'Cleansing Cream'. They officially concluded their promotional activities on November 18 with a final performance on KBS's ‘Music Bank'. The members branched out to solo activities once again. Starting with Miryo, releasing her self- produced solo album, MIRYO a.k.a. JOHONEY on February 1. She had a rocky start with two of the songs from her album banned in broadcasting stations. namely, “Revenger,” which according to SBS officials has lyrics depicting violence and the title track “Dirty” for the lyrics of the song, containing the word, “cross-eyed” which could be perceived as a derogatory term for the disabled thus forcing Miryo to change the lyrics to be able to perform on music shows. On TV, Narsha made her acting debut with MBC's drama \"Light and Shadow\" playing the role of an aspiring singer Lee Jung Ja and followed by Ooh La La Couple as a goddess. The other members participated on reality programs. Gain became a CEO of a public relations company called ‘Mental Breakdown' particularly for the show, \"OnStyle's Launch My Life – Ga In's Fashion King.\" While Miryo was included in Mnet's hiphop program Show me the Money, collaborating with a rookie rapper to compete against other contestants for the top spot. Jea also became a fixed member of Immortal Songs 2 but she later left the show due to her solo album promotions and was replaced by Narsha which later on left the show also due to her musical \"When A Man Loves.\" On July 17, BEG released their digital single \"The Original\" of the hybrid soul genre – the genre the girls have originally debuted with. It has two tracks Come with me and the title track “A Midsummer Night's Dream” meant to be a gift to the fans who are still supporting the group despite it not being active at the moment. It was produced and composed by JeA. No promotional activities were done. Gain dropped her second mini-album on October 5 \"Talk About S\" with the title track Bloom.

While Brown Eyed Girls members have been well known to venture into solo activities, this is the first time in which two members will be working together as one team. On November 11, M&N released their first single, titled \"Tonight (오늘밤),\" which included two versions of the same track (one Korean, one English version), with the lyrical content to the first version being self-composed between the two members - on a later date during an interview, both members of the sub-unit stated that they had plans to release an album sometime within the next year, with it to feature a strong Hip Hop sound complete with promotional activities.

On August 6 it was announced that the group would be releasing a \"greatest hits\" album titled Special Moments , featuring several songs from the group's eight-year career, as well as a new track \"Hush,\" which would serve as the title track to the album.

Youngest member Gain revealed during the showcase that she took part in choreographing Warm Hole and Brave New World, as well as forming the concept for their 6th album. The album and the music video for Brave New World got released on the same day. The reference to Aldous Huxley 's novel Brave New World became obvious, though the theme of music video and song do not refer to discouragement of critical thinking, abundance of material goods and other plots as the novel does. However, the futuristic theme got picked up through time traveling in the music video as well as the idea of a dystopian state through the lyrics. The Warm Hole MV got released on November 5 and sparked a controversy due to the heavy sexual lyrics and references in the MV to a female's reproductive organ.

The group members have also been featured on several South Korean drama soundtracks including The Vineyard Man ( Loving You ), Queen of Games ( 독한 사랑 ), Dae Jo Yeong ( 대조영 ), The Kingdom of The Winds ( 다애 ), My Fair Lady ( I Love You ), and The Slave Hunters ( Stray Child ). JeA also participated in OST songs even before Brown Eyed Girls' debut. Also, Miryo and JeA collaborated for the single \"Love Is...\" which was released in May 2010.

The band consists of Jung Yong-hwa (leader, main vocals, guitar , keyboard, rap ), Kang Min-hyuk ( drums ), and Lee Jung-shin ( bass ). First bassist Kwon Kwang-jin left the band after they released their debut Japanese extended play Now or Never in 2009, and was replaced by Lee Jung-shin. Lee Jong-hyun (guitar and vocals) left the band on August 28, 2019. CN is an initialism for Code name , while BLUE is a backronym for burning , lovely , untouchable , and emotional ; it is meant to portray the images of Jong-hyun, Min-hyuk, Jung-shin, and Yong-hwa, respectively. On January 14, 2010, CNBLUE debuted in Korea with the lead single \" I'm a Loner \" from their first Korean EP Bluetory . CNBLUE's first live performance took place in Tokyo , Japan, at the entrance of Shinjuku Station in early 2009; it was one of at least 20 other bands performing in the area. By mid-June 2009, the band began to perform on the streets and in live clubs. They formally debuted on August 19, 2009 with Now or Never . The EP was recorded completely in English, and failed to chart on the Oricon Albums Chart . In late September, their original bassist Kwon Kwang-jin left the band and was replaced by Lee Jung-shin later that year. Their second extended play Voice was released in November. Recorded with both English and Japanese tracks, Voice peaked at number 227 and charted for two weeks. Guitarist Lee described the band's independence in the country as \"tough, but equally rewarding\". In January, FNC Entertainment unveiled a series of video teasers for CNBLUE's debut in South Korea.

Crying Nut claimed that not only did CNBLUE use the song without permission, but also lip-synced along with the original Crying Nut recording. Crying Nut allegedly posted online that CNBLUE \"must pay the penalties for intellectual property rights infringement\".

However, after years of debate in court, CNBLUE lost the lawsuit and its agency was fined 15 million won. CNBLUE undertakes philanthropy work such as donating money and rice to the needy from time to time. Part of their yearly income and the income from the Bluemoon World Tour have been contributed to the construction of CNBLUE Schools.

They released their debut mini-album Timeless: Begins in 2012, which peaked at #8 on the Gaon weekly album chart. On May 26, 2012, Amuse Korea revealed that they would be debuting a multinational group consisting of South Korean, Japanese and Chinese singers.

    rdfs:label "Crayon_Pop" ;
    dbo:abstract """ Crayon Pop ( Hangul : 크레용팝) is a South Korean girl group formed under Chrome Entertainment in 2012. The group consists of four members: Geummi, Ellin, Choa, and Way. Their fifth member, Soyul, left the group in 2017. Crayon Pop officially debuted in July 2012 with their performance of "Saturday Night" on Mnet 's M! Countdown . Their first EP was not a commercial success, and when their song "Dancing Queen" was released in October, the group had few opportunities to promote on music shows . Instead they held guerrilla performances on the streets of Seoul, which helped increase their fanbase. Crayon Pop gained a huge increase in popularity following the release of their single album " Bar Bar Bar " in June 2013. The group's unique stage outfits and choreography gained public attention, and made the title song a viral hit. It eventually managed to reach number 1 on Billboard 's K-Pop Hot 100 . Crayon Pop was able to earn numerous awards, including the New Rising Star Award at the Golden Disk Awards , the Hot Trend Award at the MelOn Music Awards , and Best New Female Artist at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . The group has held solo concerts in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, and has also performed in other countries including Australia and China. Throughout June and July 2014, the group was an opening act Lady Gaga 's ArtRave: The Artpop Ball concert tour. Crayon Pop performed for it in 12 cities around the United States and Canada. Following their appearance in the Artpop tour, the group debuted their first subunit in October. The unit is named Strawberry Milk, and consists of the twin members Choa and Way. In March 2015, Crayon Pop released their second mini album FM , for which they used Super Sentai inspired costumes. They released the song "RaRiRuRe" in June of that same year, which was their debut in the Japanese music market. The group continued their Japanese promotions with their second single "Dancing All Night" in November. Their first Japanese studio album Crayon Pop was released January 2016, and it ranked #11 on Oricon's Daily Album Charts . Crayon Pop collaborated with Mexican boy band CD9 in August, to release the song "Get Dumb". In September, Crayon Pop released the song "Vroom Vroom" ahead of their first album Crayon Pop Evolution Pop Vol. 1 . They soon released the music video for "Doo Doom Chit", another song that would feature on the track list of the album. On 19 April 2017, the group announced their contracts with Chrome Media had ended in March and they had gone their separate ways, although they would not be officially disbanding. On 30 May, it was revealed that Way, Choa, Geummi and Ellin would continue to promote as Crayon Pop under Chrome Entertainment, but Soyul had chosen to leave the group. The group was initially named Hurricane Pop, and consisted of members Serang (Yang Se-hyeon), Geummi (Baek Bo-ram), Ellin (Kim Min-young), Choa (Heo Min-jin), and Soyul (Park Hye-kyeong). Chrome Entertainment's CEO, Hwang Hyun-chang, did not consider candidates who were taller than 165 cm or had a sexy image, because he wanted a group of ordinary girls. Soyul was the first member to be accepted, and Geummi was the next to join. Serang, under the name Mari, had formerly been the leader of the disbanded girl group Coin Jackson. Ellin was referred to Chrome Entertainment by Chrome's dance choreographer and was accepted after her third audition. Choa was recommended to the company by Way, her twin sister. Way had been invited to audition, but was unable to do so because she was a member of the indie band N.Dolphin. Singer Bumkey was involved in the audition process and also supervised the group's vocal training. The group recorded their first song 'Bing Bing' as Hurricane Pop. In January 2012, they performed the song live for the first time in Hangzhou , China. The performance of 'Bing Bing' was filmed for the Chinese television drama Curry Campus . A music video for their song was filmed in February, but Serang left the group in May to pursue an acting career. After Serang's departure, Way was given another chance to join the group and she left N.Dolphin. Shortly before their debut the group's name was changed to Crayon Pop, as Chrome Entertainment thought the name Hurricane Pop would be insensitive in light of Japan's tsunamis . The members' stage names were chosen by the company's CEO, although several of them had input into the choice. Crayon Pop began their promotions in Japan in May 2012, using their time there to film music videos for "Bing Bing". The group released both the Korean and Japanese music videos in June. The music video for their debut single "Saturday Night" was released on 17 July, followed by a Japanese version, as well as an alternate version with new footage, on 24 July. Crayon Pop's first EP , Crayon Pop 1st Mini Album , was released digitally on 18 July and included both "Bing Bing" and "Saturday Night". The group made their official stage debut the following day on 19 July, performing "Saturday Night" on Mnet 's M! Countdown . Crayon Pop's debut did not receive much attention and their album was not commercially successful. Chrome Entertainment's CEO later revealed that the album had depleted all the company's money. Crayon Pop released a digital single album, "Dancing Queen", on 24 October 2012. Besides the title track, it also included a remixed version of "Bing Bing". In order to stand out from other girl groups, Crayon Pop wore tracksuits instead of more feminine clothing. After seeing a performance of "Dancing Queen", Kangin and Shindong of Super Junior praised the song and group, with Shindong saying "I'd love to produce a girl group like them". Crayon Pop was only invited to perform on music shows three times, and they were not able to have a typical promotion cycle. As a result, they took to the streets and promoted "Dancing Queen" with guerrilla performances, which often took place in extremely cold weather. Chrome Entertainment also produced a reality web series about the group, titled Crayon Pop TV . Through these activities, Crayon Pop developed a loyal fanbase, especially of "uncle fans" called "Pop-jeossi" (from the Korean word ajeossi ). Crayon Pop returned to Japan and held a mini-concert on 6 January 2013 in Shibuya, Tokyo . Tickets went on sale on 11 December 2012, and sold out in less than an hour. As a result of considerable demand from fans unable to purchase tickets, Chrome Entertainment announced that another Japanese concert would be held at a later date, and a second mini-concert was staged in Osaka on 22 February. On 25 January, Crayon Pop began promoting the remixed version of "Bing Bing", which included a popping dance break to Daft Punk 's " Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger " instead of the original rap verse. They had a "delinquent schoolgirl" concept with new choreography, and wore tracksuits or school uniforms with tracksuit pants. On 19 May, a third Japanese mini-concert was held in Shibuya, Tokyo. A new Japanese member, Arisa, was to be revealed at this concert, but she had withdrawn from the group before the performance. On 8 June, Crayon Pop performed a preview version of their new song " Bar Bar Bar ". The unusual dance featured choreographed jumping, and they wore scooter helmets, polo shirts, and tracksuit pants with skirts. A story version music video was released on 13 June, a week before the song's digital release on 20 June. Three days later, a dance version music video was released. Filmed with a budget of only 380,000 won (US$347), the music video went viral and Crayon Pop drew interest due to their unique stage outfits and choreography. This music video has more than 51 million views on YouTube as of April 2019. As "Bar Bar Bar" went viral, it began to climb the Korean digital music charts, eventually reaching the upper positions of most major real time chart listings. It stayed at the top of Billboard 's Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart for more than a month, and ranked number 1 for the first time eight weeks after release. "Bar Bar Bar" solidified its viral status when a parody video was aired on a segment of SNL Korea on 13 August. That same day, it was announced that Crayon Pop had signed a contract with Sony Music Entertainment , who were inspired by the groups' creativity and uniqueness and saw their global market potential. Crayon Pop scored their first music show win when "Bar Bar Bar" won first place on Music Bank on 30 August, beating EXO 's " Growl ". On 9 September, a "Global Version" music video was released ahead of Crayon Pop's second mini album, The Streets Go Disco , which was released on 26 September under the Sony Music label. This album consisted of their four previous singles and remixes of those songs. A music video for the title track, "Dancing Queen 2.0", was released along with the album. "Bar Bar Bar" earned Chrome Entertainment US$2 million in the year after its release, and Crayon Pop was able to move from their small row house in Nonhyeon-dong to a luxury "villa" apartment due to their increased income. Crayon Pop's rising popularity also brought them criticism. Netizens accused the group of being affiliated with the right-wing website Ilbe after Way used the phrase nomu nomu (노무노무) on Twitter. This phrase was popularized on Ilbe and was used to criticize former president Roh Moo-hyun . It was then discovered that Chrome Entertainment's CEO previously mentioned the website on Twitter. CEO Hwang responded by saying he was registered on many popular online communities, including Ilbe, in order to gather information about singers and girl groups. He also stated that Way's phrase was an example of aegyo and she was not even aware of the website. However, the controversy continued and several of the group's scheduled events were cancelled after criticism from the public. Online auction company Auction stopped broadcasting its new TV commercial featuring Crayon Pop after widespread customer complaints. The controversy resurfaced in January 2014 after Ellin allegedly used the Ilbe hand sign, but Chrome Entertainment explained that Ellin was forming the letter "E" with her hand, and all the Crayon Pop members have alphabet hand signs that signify their names. Due to Crayon Pop's increased popularity, they had more opportunities to perform. On 27 July, they held their first mini-concert in South Korea. [ citation needed ] The group first performed in China on 9 August at the 23rd Qingdao International Beer Festival, and they performed in the United States for the first time at KCON on 25 August. On 30 October, Crayon Pop held a solo concert titled 1st POPCON in Seoul. As a token of appreciation, the concert was free to attend and 100% , My name , Bumkey and The SeeYa appeared as special guests. The concert was broadcast on MBC Music on 12 November. Crayon Pop held another solo concert, 2nd POPCON in Tokyo, on 15 November at Zepp DiverCity, Tokyo with more than 2,000 fans, 30 media outlets, and 200 representatives in the music industry in attendance.

Chrome Entertainment later released a statement contradicting this, saying Way's contract ended in May, not in March as previously stated. On 8 May, it was confirmed that although both parties had repeatedly denied the rumours of a pregnancy and shotgun marriage, Soyul was pregnant and would be giving birth to a girl the same month. On 31 May, an announcement was made that Geummi, Ellin, Choa and Way signed a non-exclusive contract under Chrome Entertainment to promote as Crayon Pop, however their solo careers would be managed by other labels.

All of them, with the exception of Ellin, were featured on KBS2's The Return of Superman , where Soyul's family are regular cast members. Crayon Pop's music is often described as electropop and disco-pop dance music with addictive and repetitive lyrics and melodies. Their first single, "Saturday Night", was a 1980s -inspired "electro-pop dance song with a retro melody". After the release of "Bar Bar Bar", Corynn Smith of MTV called Crayon Pop "a disco-pop K-Pop group that is obviously having a blast" with "bafflingly simple lyrics and unexpected choreography." Pops in Seoul described " Lonely Christmas " as "a dance song with funk and disco sounds", while Billboard magazine noted the song's catchy hook and energetic synths, trumpets and guitars. Crayon Pop's sixth single, "Uh-ee", is a mix of electronic sounds and trot . Chrome Entertainment called the genre " house electronic trot" because it "is composed of fast beats and strong electronic sounds with addictive trot melody". Billboard described the song as having a hyper- techno dance beat that would fit into Dance Dance Revolution , while the dance routine was "more like an intense aerobic workout than a silly dance". Strawberry Milk ( Korean : 딸기 우유 ; RR : Ttalgiuyu ) is Crayon Pop's first subgroup, featuring twins Choa and Way. Chrome Entertainment announced the subgroup (also called a unit or sub-unit) on 29 September 2014. Their debut album, The 1st Mini Album , was released on 15 October, along with a music video for the title track, "OK". Another song on the album, "Let Me Know", was written by Way. The lyrics are based on the twins' struggle to become singers. In April 2015, Choa and Way were featured on Kim Yoo-min's "Road" (길), the lead single from his debut mini album (released under the stage name, Bear Planet). The sisters also played two of the lead roles in the music video. On 13 January 2016, the sisters released the single "I Hate You" (나가 미워). On 2 July, they released the single "Always" ( 늘 ) for the soundtrack of the television drama Mirror of the Witch . In 2017, both Choa and Way started a YouTube vlogging channel, which the two would share together and post regularly. At the beginning of December, it was announced via the twins' Instagram accounts that they would release a Christmas duet titled 'Christmas For You' on the 16th of that month.

    rdfs:label "EXID" ;
    dbo:abstract " EXID ( / iː ˈ ɛ k s aɪ ˈ d iː / ; Korean : 이엑스아이디 ; short for \"Exceed in Dreaming\"), is a South Korean girl group formed in 2012. The group currently consists of five members: Solji , LE , Hani , Hyelin and Jeonghwa . EXID debuted in February 2012, with the single \"Whoz That Girl\". Though the album gained some attention, it was not until 2014 that the group unexpectedly gained popularity with the single \" Up & Down \", which reached number one on the Gaon Singles Chart four months after release due to a fan-recording of a live performance becoming a viral video . EXID released their second EP Ah Yeah in April 2015, to commercial success. They followed this with their first studio album Street (2016) and the EPs Eclipse and Full Moon (2017). In May 2011, producer Shinsadong Tiger and AB Entertainment scouted several trainees from JYP Entertainment to form a new girl group. Trainee Yuji was the first to join when a JYP girl group failed to debut. Yuji contacted the trainees Hani, Haeryeong, and Jeonghwa to audition for AB, and all three were subsequently accepted into the agency. The group added a fifth member when Shinsadong Tiger discovered LE , an underground rapper and songwriter who performed under the name Elly. Dami, who was already an AB trainee, was the sixth and last member added to the group. Originally named \"WT\", an acronym for \"Who's That\", the group changed their name to EXID a few months before their debut. In December 2011, LE was featured in Huh Gak 's single \"Whenever You Play That Song\", which appeared on Korean music charts. EXID was scheduled to debut in January 2012, but their debut was delayed to February when LE sustained a leg injury during rehearsals. On February 3, AB Entertainment announced that EXID would debut with the single \"Whoz That Girl\". Video teasers featuring the members doing solo performances were subsequently released online. EXID released their first single \"Whoz That Girl\" from the digital single album Holla , on February 16, 2012. They made their debut performance on M! Countdown , and then performed on Music Core and Inkigayo . Their debut song \"Whoz That Girl\" peaked at number 36 on the Gaon Singles Chart and ultimately sold 840,000 digital copies. In April 2012, AB Entertainment officially announced members Yuji, Dami, and Haeryeong's departure and said in a statement that Yuji and Dami had left the group to focus on their studies, while Haeryeong had left to pursue an acting career. They were replaced by Solji, a former member of vocal duo 2NB , and Hyelin, who was originally considered for EXID's original lineup before she was dropped. With the new members, EXID returned in August 2012 with their second single \"I Feel Good\" from their first EP Hippity Hop . Hippity Hop debuted at number 13 on the Gaon Albums Chart , selling 1,500 copies. EXID released the digital single \" Every Night \", in October. The title track is an alternate version of LE's self-written song \"Phone Call\", which was recorded in their debut EP. \"Every Night\" debuted at number 43 on the Gaon Singles Chart, selling 105,000 digital copies. On October 11, EXID released the song \"Hey Boy\" as part of the soundtrack release for MBC 's sitcom The Thousandth Man. The song is the female version of B1A4 's song \"Hey Girl\". Producer Shinsadong Tiger rearranged the song into a \"reggae style\" to create a different approach from B1A4's original version. It was revealed on November 30 that EXID, along with Big Star and D-Unit , would release a collaboration album, in addition to doing a special year of end show. The concert, entitled \"The Bugs Show Vol. 1\", was held on December 22 at the V-Hall in the Hongdae area of Seoul . On December 6, EXID won the rookie award at the 20th Korea Culture & Entertainment Awards. In February 2013, EXID released the single \"Up & Down\", from the Incarnation of Money soundtrack. It was announced shortly afterwards that members Hani and Solji would form a subunit called \"Dasoni\". The sub-unit released their debut single \"Goodbye\" on February 15, with the B-side track \"Said So Often\". In June 2014, EXID was announced to have signed an exclusive contract with Yedang Entertainment, and were preparing a comeback in collaboration with producer Shinsadong Tiger. On August 24, 2014, EXID held their comeback showcase at the Ilchi Art Hall, performing their new song \" Up & Down \". The song was released on August 27, 2014 and initially charted poorly, failing to make it onto the top 100 of the Gaon Chart ; though it peaked at number 94 on the domestic chart. However, the song slowly gained popularity in early October 2014 after a fan-recorded video of Hani performing the song went viral on South Korean social networking websites. This led to the song shooting back up record charts, eventually climbing into the top 10 on the real-time charts and topping the Gaon Chart. Because of the success of the fancam, EXID was invited back onto stage to promote despite the fact their promotions ended months prior. Due to this success, EXID returned to several music programs to promote \"Up and Down\". The song was subsequently nominated for a first place award on Show! Music Core , Inkigayo , and M Countdown , where they took their first music show win since debut. The group won a second award at Music Bank on January 9, 2015, and a third one at Inkigayo on January 11, 2015. On April 13, 2015, the music video for the title song \"Ah Yeah\", from EXID's second EP, was released.

On January 11, 2016, EXID signed with China's entertainment company Banana Project in a bid to extend its popularity outside Korea. This sparked discussions regarding EXID's future activities in South Korea; however, CEO of Banana Culture Music Wang Sicong assured fans that the next album his company invested on EXID would be released simultaneously in China and South Korea. On March 2, EXID's record label Yedang Entertainment changes name to Banana Culture, launching a joint venture company in Seoul with Banana Project. On March 18, EXID held their first Chinese fan meeting, 'EXID's LEGGO Show in Shanghai'. On June 1, the group released their first studio album titled Street with the title track \"L.I.E\". Street includes 12 tracks, many of which were written and/or composed by LE. EXID's first studio album also included \"Hello\", a solo song by lead vocalist Hani and \"3%\", a solo song sung by main vocalist Solji. The album peaked at number two in Korea on the Gaon Album Chart, while \"L.I.E\" peaked at number five as a single. On June 8, 2016, EXID won first place with \"L.I.E\" on Show Champion and soon after, they won first place on both Inkigayo and The Show as well. On December 20, 2016, EXID released their first Chinese single, \"Cream\" on QQ Music and YinYueTai -which peaked at number six on the Billboard China V Chart. However, a day later, Banana Culture announced that Solji had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism , and that she would halt all her activities for the awards season of 2016-17, while the remaining four members continue on. On January 10, 2017, the group released their second Chinese single \"Up & Down\" ( Chinese : 上下 ; pinyin : Shàngxià ). On the same day of its release, an edited version music video for \"Up & Down (Chinese Ver.)\" was uploaded to YouTube and the original was removed. Some Chinese fans found EXID's dancing in the ' Forbidden City ' to be inappropriate whilst some thought that it was completely normal. On March 17, the four members of EXID excluding Solji performed at the Mexico City Arena as part of the KCON music festival in Mexico, with Hani covering Mexican duo Jesse & Joy 's \"Ecos De Amor\". Due to Solji's remaining health issues, the group's comeback was delayed until April. Their agency announced in March that EXID would return as a four-piece while Solji recovered from her hyperthyroidism. On April 10, EXID officially released their third EP Eclipse and their title song \"Night Rather Than Day\". Eclipse debuted at number four on the Billboard World Albums chart , becoming the group's best-charting – and first top-five – album on the chart to date. On April 25, 2017, EXID won first place on The Show with \"Night Rather Than Day\". This was followed by their second win with this song on Show Champion the following day and their third win on The Show on May 2, 2017. On May 12, Banana Culture Entertainment has announced that EXID would embark on a promotional Asian tour during the summer. Titled ‘EXID Asia Tour 2017’, the group visited a handful of countries for the tour, starting in Hong Kong and Singapore. They originally planned to visited Taiwan on July 30, before performing a homecoming concert in Seoul on August 12; however, due to safety concerns over the threat of Typhoon Nesat , the Taiwanese show was postponed to August 26. Solji gave a surprise appearance at the encore of the Seoul concert before resuming her treatment; neither the audience nor the rest of the group knew of her visit. The Asian tour wrapped with their Taipei concert on August 26. EXID's fourth mini album Full Moon was released on November 7, 2017. This marks the return of member Solji, who was absent from the group since 2016. This time, Solji only participated in the recording process but was absent from the promotions and the title track's music video. On November 21, 2017, EXID won first place on The Show with \"DDD\". From December 2017 onwards, EXID, through their social media platforms, shared photo teasers for a project named re:flower , whose songs would be remasters and remakes of past their songs that weren't title songs. EXID returned with a single album Lady on April 2, 2018, only promoting as four, however, due to Solji still recovering from surgery. The lead track for the album is entitled \"내일해 (Lady)\". On April 10, 2018, EXID won first place on The Show with \"Lady\". On 11 May, Banana Culture announced EXID's launching of their Japanese official website, which included a Japanese fan club. They also announced a debut showcase at Tokyo to be held on June 27. During the showcase, EXID announced their release of the Japanese version of \"Up & Down\" on August 22, as well as their first Japanese tour to be held between August 23 and 25, with Solji confirming that she will have returned by then. On July 22 and 29, Solji returned as a contestant in episode 163-164 of MBC's singing competition program King of Mask Singer as 'Dongmakgol Girl' and emerged victorious, being crowned the 82nd generation of 'Mask King'. On September 6, Banana Culture released a statement, announcing that Solji will join EXID on September 7 to attend the 2018 Hallyu Pop Festival in Singapore as her first official schedule. This marked the formal return of Solji into EXID, of which she will be joining in all of their future group promotions. Solji appeared with the rest of the group members on stage on August 10, on day 2 of HallyuPopFest 2018 , in which she performed 5 of their title tracks with the group. Solji continued to successfully defend herself over all contestants in the next 8 episodes since her initial victory in King of Mask Singer , before ending her streak as the winner of 82th to 86th generation on October 21. After her defeat, she revealed her identity, and explained her choice of return through the show as it was where she rose to fame. To further their promotions since their debut in Japan, the music video for the Japanese version of \"Up & Down\" was released early on August 10 before the launch of the Japanese debut album, which debuted at number 15 on the Daily chart of Oricon. On November 11, EXID made a full-member comeback with the single album I Love You , while releasing the music video with the same title. \"I Love You\" entered Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart at number 5, which was by far their highest achievement in the chart. On December 31, 2018, EXID performed at Taipei New Year's Eve Countdown Party in Taipei, Taiwan, and stayed there through the countdown to 2019. In February 2019, EXID held their second Japanese live tour, titled \"2019 EXID Valentine Japan Live Tour\". During the tour, EXID also performed their new Japanese single Trouble , which is the title track of their first Japanese studio album of the same name. Trouble was released in Japan on April 3, 2019. Trouble debuted and peaked at number 12 on the Oricon Albums Chart and at number 23 on Billboard Japan ' s Hot Albums. It also peaked at number 10 on Billboard Japan ' s Top Albums Sales, with 4,831 physical copies sold in its first week. In early May 2019, members Hani and Jeonghwa had decided to not renew their contracts with Banana Culture. Shortly after, it was announced that the group will release an extended play on May 15, 2019. It was agreed that all the members will participate in promotion activities and after the conclusion of this, the group will enter an indefinite hiatus so each member could focus on individual activities. EXID released their fifth EP \" WE \" alongside the title track \"Me & You\" on May 15, 2019. The EP debuted at 8 on the US World Albums Chart , becoming their fourth top 10 entry on the chart. It sold 24,423 physical copies in South Korea that month. Banana Culture later clarified that the group would continue activities as five in Japan for another year, with a Japanese tour entitled \"2019 EXID Summer Live Tour\" beginning in August. EXID released a Japanese single entitled \"Bad Girl For You\" in December 2019. It charted at number 14 on the Oricon Singles Chart , becoming their second entry on the chart. On January 15, 2020, Hyelin also left Banana Culture. On February 5, 2020, Solji left Banana Culture. On March 25, 2020, LE left Banana Culture.

    rdfs:label "F-ve_Dolls" ;
    dbo:abstract """F-ve Dolls ( Korean : 파이브돌스 ; sometimes stylized as F-VE DOLLS , formerly known as 5dolls ) was a South Korean girl group formed by Core Contents Media in 2011. The group was composed of six members: Hyoyoung, Seunghee, Yeonkyung, Hyewon, Eunkyo and Nayeon. They debuted with two single tracks, "Lip Stains" (입술자국) and "I Mean You" (너 말이야), in 2011. The group was known as "Female Unit" of Coed School until CCM 's announced that the group became independent in 2013. The group disbanded on March 10, 2015. On December 2010, Coed School broke into sub-groups. The female members Lee Soo-mi, Heo Chan-mi, Ryu Hyo-young and Jin Hye-won, with the addition of new member Seo Eun-kyo, became 5dolls. On January 20, 2011, 5dolls released two promotional videos featuring Jay Park , one called "Lip Stains" and the other one called "I Mean You" (or "It's You"). The group released its first mini album on February 16, 2011 and debuted on M! Countdown on February 17, 2011. During their live performances, the group received criticism for presumably lip synching. 5dolls released their second mini-album Time To Play on May 11, 2011 with their lead single "Like This Or That" (이러쿵 저러쿵) and the music video. "Like This or That" stands as the highest selling song for a rookie of 2011 with $192,000 USD grossed. [ citation needed ] 2012 saw the departure of both Soomi and Chanmi from the group, in February and summer respectively. Ha Na-yeon and Shannon were announced as replacements and, in February 2013, trainee Choi Ji-hyun was also said to be joining the group, thus becoming six. On July 8, 2013, the group officially announced that they would be returning at the end of the month with a new single called "Soulmate #1" as well as a new stage name, F-ve Dolls. However, of the three new members announced, only Nayeon stayed, and the other two gaps were filled by Cho Seung-hee and The SeeYa member Oh Yeon-kyung, who simultaneously promoted the two groups. On July 31, 2013, their first digital single "Since 1971" was released with the music video of the title track "Soulmate #1". The song charted 62 on the Gaon Chart and 44 on the Billboard Korea Hot 100. F-ve Dolls promoted "Soulmate #1" from July 31 through September 1, 2013. F-ve Dolls followed-up promotions with a new mini-album called "First Love", which was released on September 17. The group promoted with the song "Can You Love Me?", which features new T-ara N4 member Kim Dani , making it her debut. On 17 September 2013, a second version of "Can You Love Me?" music video and a music video for the song "Deceive" were released. On November 2014, it was reported that F-ve Dolls was disbanded after their labels were renamed, and subsequently F-ve dolls was deleted from the official label's website. On March 10, 2015, the label confirmed the official disbandment of the group. It was stated that those members who still had a contract with the agency will be part of a new group. On September 2015, Cho Seunghee re-debuted with new group DIA , but she left the group the following year.

    dbo:abstract " Fiestar ( Korean : 피에스타 ) was a South Korean girl group formed by Kakao M . Before the group's debut, they released a duet with label mate IU titled “Sea of Moonlight” for LOEN Entertainment's collective label album. The track ended up being a domestic success and entered the top ten of the Gaon Digital Chart, earning the group attention before their debut. The group officially debuted on August 31, 2012 with the single album “ Vista ” and six members Cao Lu , Jei, Linzy, Hyemi, Cheska and Yezi to critical acclaim and commercial success. The group released their second single album “ We Don’t Stop ” on November 9, this time to mixed reviews. On March 20, 2014 member Cheska officially left the group. In July of that same year, the group released a song titled “One More” to backlash and controversy due to its supposedly risqué lyrics, the song ended up being banned from broadcast by MBC , and the group had to change the lyrics for their follow up promotions. The group's first mini album was released in March 2015 titled Black Label . The group's second mini album was released in March 2016 titled A Delicate Sense , two months later the group released the song “ Apple Pie ” which ended up being their last single before the group's official disbandment in May 2018 following their contract expiration. Prior to their debut, the members of Fiestar had been training as a group for two years and individually for an average of four years. Cao Lu had previously debuted as a soloist in China after winning a 2004 CCTV singing contest. Her album Cat was released in 2005 under the stage name LuLu. The group's leader, Jei, had previously been a model for online clothing stores and appeared in music videos including Infinite 's \"Paradise\", and Bongshil Sister's \"My Love\". She also featured on Taw's \"Happy Hours\", under the stage name Joo. Linzy had been a trainee under YG Entertainment and was intended to be a 2NE1 member and then a member of another YG girl group, before the band was scrapped before debut. In 2010, she recorded a song for the Korean drama Obstetrics and Gynecology . Before their official debut, Fiestar released a duet with label mate IU for LOEN Entertainment's collective label album. The track was titled \"Sea of Moonlight\" and was a domestic chart success. They also collaborated with Tiger JK for the pre-release song \"Wicked\". The group released their first official single, \" Vista \", on August 31, 2012. The tracks from the corresponding EP all charted on the K-pop Billboard Hot 100. Fiestar's second single \" We Don't Stop \" was released on November 9, with the B-side track \"Sweet Love\" featuring ballad singer Kim Yeon-woo . Live promotions for the album began on Music Bank the following day. Alongside group promotions, Jei appeared in TVN 's reality program Romantic and Idol , and alongside IU for the comedy show Gag Concert along with Jei, Cao Lu and Linzy. Vocalists Linzy and Hyemi appeared on KBS 's 1000 Song Challenge , and the group as a whole made appearances on Weekly Idol and Dream Team 2 . They also endorsed HIM Magazine. In 2013, Linzy played Sharpay Evans in the CJE&M Korean musical adaptation of High School Musical , sharing the role with The Grace 's Dana . The show's run began on July 2 at the Blue Square Samsung Card Hall. During the year Fiestar also participated in a video series entitled \" Fiestar's A-HA! For the Global K-Pop Fan \" as well as endorsements for the Samsung Galaxy S4 . On August 27, a pre-release single, \"Whoo!\" featuring Eric Benét , was released online. Despite there being no live promotions for the single, it was a chart success. In September, LOEN Entertainment created the sub-label Collabodadi, under which Fiestar would continue to release their music. On November 1, Fiestar released the single \"I Don't Know\" from the EP Curious , making their stage comeback on Music Core the following day. Following promotions, the reality television show Channel FIESTAR! aired on SBS MTV . On March 20, 2014, LOEN Entertainment announced that Cheska would be leaving the group and would not be replaced by any new members, and Fiestar's comeback was scheduled for mid-July after being postponed due to the Sewol ferry tragedy . On June 16, a single in collaboration between The Friends and Fiestar for the 2014 Brazil World Cup titled \"I Love Korea\" was released. On July 1, the music video for the single \"One More\" was released. On March 4, 2015 Fiestar's first mini album Black Label was released with title track \"You're Pitiful\". Six months after the album's release, on September 22, Collabodadi was dissolved, with LOEN Tree becoming the sole in-house label of LOEN Entertainment. Thus, Fiestar returned to LOEN Tree after a two-year run under Collabodadi. On December 17, Cao Lu appeared on Radio Star as a guest along with rapper Jessi , Got7 's Jackson , and Lena Park as part of the Outsiders special. She gained national attention for her appearance on the program and became the number one trending topic on Naver , with Fiestar also trending. In March 2016, Fiestar released their second mini album A Delicate Sense . The album consists of six tracks, including lead single \"Mirror\". Notably, all the members also participated in the production. On May 31, 2016 Fiestar returned with the digital single \"Apple Pie\". On May 15, 2018 it was announced that Fiestar had disbanded following the expiration of majority members contracts on April 30 and only Cao Lu 's contract would be expiring on May 31. On May 29, 2018, former member Cheska announced via her Instagram that she was quitting music. She thanked her fans for supporting her, but that as \"music was slowly killing [her]\", she had decided to walk away. Fiestar's single \"One More\" was banned from broadcast by MBC for its supposedly risqué lyrics. While the song had originally passed scrutiny from the three major broadcasting stations ( KBS , MBC and SBS ), backlash from public commentators forced the networks to review the song's content. While their representatives claimed that the song was innocuous, the group re-recorded the song and changed the lyrics. The controversy spawned from the lyrics prompted MBC to crack down further on songs with ambiguous or easily misconstrued lyrical content. In 2020, Cheska, who became an online streamer after she quit music, shared an exposé about Fiestar's poor team dynamics, including bullying within the group and the dark side of K-Pop. She also revealed that LOEN had deliberately misinformed the public about her birthplace. She was actually born in Seoul, Korea. Her listed birthplace of Birmingham, Alabama , USA was where she grew up since she was a toddler. " ;

On April 6, 2020 the group released their third EP titled I Trust with \" Oh My God \" as its lead single. The album consists of five songs including an English-language version of the title track. It had over 91,311 pre-orders, making it their most pre-ordered EP, and became their highest selling album of 100,000 physical copies in three days. The music video for \"Oh My God\" broke their personal record by amassing 17 million views within its first day of release. In conjunction with the release of I Trust , (G)I-dle had signed with Republic Records to help highlight and push their individuality into the U.S. marketplace. (G)I-dle was praised for their musicality and ambiguity. Natalie Morin from Refinery29 described them as individuals with different energies that complements each other. She also described them as \"bold and sensual\", characteristics which she asserts sets them apart from other K-pop girl groups. Mor.bo named them as a diverse group that is unafraid to try different music styles. Elle magazine named the group as \"independent musicians and artists\" where girl groups' concepts typically work within a mold that was made by someone else. Despite being the youngest group to appear on Queendom , (G)I-dle members were actively involved in their own music videos, jacket photoshoots, song arrangements, choreography, and outfits production. Taylor Glasby from MTV stated that (G)I-dle songs are steeped in their very essence — a girl's complex, internal house of mirrors that is constantly being broken, assessed, understood, and remade, where one style or sound is never enough to reflect who they are. (G)I-dle is the enticing tropical beats and coy finger snaps of \"Latata\" and the ominous, warning whistled hook of \"Hann (Alone)\". They are also the pensive harmonies and slow throb of bass on the R&B-infused ballad \"Put It Straight,\" the whimsical words painted over the house music of \"What's In Your House,\" and even the tango of \"Senorita\". Their lyrics push back, they beckon. They can be boring nonchalance or sharpening desire. Kim Na-yul writing for Herald Pop described (G)I-dle's genre can only be performed by them and made a good impression on the public. Melon magazine described (G)I-dle's music generally as \"Uniqueness is (G)I-dle's most powerful weapon.\" crossing genres from \"Latata\" (moombahton), \"Hann (Alone)\" (Eastern European rhythm), \"Senorita\" (Latin pop) and \"Uh-Oh\" (Boom bap). The group was also praised for their stage presence during performances such as 2018 MMA 's golden stage reminiscent of Cleopatra , and 2018 MAMA 's stage performing with dozens of female dancers to emphasize the image of women. It is also stated that their performance for Fan-dora's Box was \"another legendary stage\" due to the emotional acting by the members where they expressed \"anger in sadness\". (G)I-dle gave their last Queendom stage, \" Lion \" with the Lion story which was narrated by Minnie, danced in golden robes ornately decorated with lion's mane and finished with a herd of lions [dancers] following (G)I-dle to the six thrones. The stage was described as \"a world-class stage\" and \"a legendary stage\". This resulted in winning several performance awards including Golden Disc Awards . The group was recognized for its brand recognition and marketing power, having topped the \"Girl Group Brand Power Ranking\" published by the Korean Business Research Institute. In 2018, they ranked #1 for June and September. Their highest brand reputation index was in September 2018. (G)I-dle has been dubbed the \"monster rookie\" of 2018. Billboard ranked them at the top of its list as the best new K-pop group of 2018. It was reported that Cube's music sales in 2018 increased by 58% to ₩8.8 billion due to the popularity of (G)I-dle's \"Latata\" and \"Hann (一)\". In 2019, (G)I-dle gained more recognition in the general public after appearing on Queendom . The performance of their finale song \"Lion\" was considered as one of K-pop's biggest moments of 2019 by CTV News . This resulted in them topping the \"Girl Group Brand Power Ranking\" for two consecutive months, in October and November 2019, respectively. Rolling Stone India included \"Lion\" in their list of the 10 Best K-Pop Music Videos of 2019. The song was considered as \"one of the most visceral tracks of 2019\" and was listed number one out of 920 songs released in 2019. In January 2020, (G)I-dle were voted as the Most Anticipated Singers/Groups in 2020 based on surveys that were participated by several Korean music agencies, broadcasting and program officials, composers and popular music critics. In February 2020, the group achieved number 1 in brand power with the most-interacted topics \"Lion\" and world tour. (G)I-dle achieved a new Guinness World Record with 1theK record challenge Kkinness Challenge on episode 4. Kkinness Challenge is an 'Idol Guinness Challenge' that contains the process by which an idol group enters Kkinness Village, an athlete village designed to challenge the world record of extreme events.

    dbo:abstract " Got7 ( Korean : 갓세븐 ) is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment . The group is composed of seven members: JB , Mark, Jackson , Jinyoung , Youngjae , BamBam , and Yugyeom. Got7 debuted in January 2014 with the release of their first EP Got It? , which peaked at number two on the Gaon Album Chart and number one on Billboard's World Albums Chart . The group gained attention for their live stage performances, which often includes elements of martial arts tricking and street dancing. In late 2014 Got7 signed with Sony Music Entertainment Japan and ventured into the Japanese market to release their debut Japanese-language single \" Around the World \". They returned to South Korea a month later to release their first full-length studio album Identify , topping the nation's charts. In 2015, Got7 released the EPs Just Right and Mad , which yielded their most commercially successful single, \"Just Right\". In 2016, they released their first full-length Japanese studio album, Moriagatteyo , debuting at number three on the Oricon Albums Chart . They then went on to release their fifth Korean EP Flight Log: Departure and their second full-length studio album Flight Log: Turbulence , both chart-toppers. In 2017, Got7 released their sixth EP Flight Log: Arrival , featuring the single \"Never Ever\". The album is the third and final part of the group's Flight Log series and at the time it was their highest selling album with more than 300,000 copies sold. In the same year they also released their seventh EP, 7 for 7 , featuring the chart-topping single \"You Are\". The album also sold over 300,000 copies. Their eighth EP, Eyes On You was released on March 12, 2018, and has sold over 300,000 copies. In 2009, JB and Jinyoung were cast into JYP Entertainment after passing open auditions. In 2010, Mark and BamBam were respectively scouted by JYP scouts in Los Angeles , USA and Bangkok , Thailand. That same year, Yugyeom became a JYP trainee after he was offered an opportunity at his dance school. In December, Jackson passed JYP's overseas audition in Hong Kong , but he did not start his training until the summer of 2011. JB and Jinyoung, then known by the stage name Junior, made their debut as actors in the 2012 television drama Dream High 2 . In May, they debuted as the pop duo JJ Project with the single \" Bounce \". The duo appeared again as actors for the 2013 drama, When a Man Falls in Love . Meanwhile, Mark, Jackson, BamBam and Yugyeom prepared for their debut together as a group. The quartet made their first television appearance on the fourth episode of Mnet 's reality-survival program Who is Next: WIN , which aired on September 6, 2013. The seventh and final member to join the group was Youngjae, who had only been a trainee for seven months. JYP Entertainment announced Got7 on January 1, 2014, debuting their first boy group since 2PM in 2008. A tentative name of the group was \"Get7\" ( Korean : 겟세븐 ), but was changed because it didn't sound good. According to Park Jin-young , \"Got7\" originated from best-selling first-generation group g.o.d , as Park was supposed to debut with them as a six-member mix-gender group and used the working name \"Got6\". The final name includes the lucky number seven, meaning \"seven lucky people come together\". Got7 was described as a hip-hop group that incorporates martial arts tricking and b-boying styles in their performances. This style drew comparisons to their senior group, 2PM , who are well known for their acrobatic dance styles. Thus, the group drew attention even before the official debut and received the nickname \"post 2PM\". Got7 released their first EP , Got It? , on January 20, 2014. The album shot to #1 on Billboard 's World Albums Chart and was #2 on the Gaon Album Chart . Got7 made their official music program debut on January 16, 2014, through Mnet's M Countdown , performing their debut single \"Girls Girls Girls\". Shortly after their debut, the group signed a contract with Japan's Sony Music Entertainment and launched a showcase in Japan in front of 9,000 fans. On June 23, Got7 released their second EP, Got Love , with its title song \"A\", which was written and produced by J.Y. Park . For their new EP, the group opted to show a brighter and more colorful image than their martial arts and b-boy style choreography emphasized at debut. In November 2014, the group released their first full-length album, Identify , as well as the music video for its title track, \"Stop Stop It\". Identify topped Gaon's Weekly Album Sales Chart in its first week and \"Stop Stop It\" peaked at number four on Billboard 's World Digital Songs chart. In October, Got7 held their first Japan Tour, \"Got7 1st Japan Tour 2014\", and made their Japanese debut on October 22 with their single Around the World . This included the hip-hop track \"So Lucky\", composed and written by 2PM 's Jun. K . In January, Got7 were awarded the \"New Artist Award\" at the 29th Golden Disc Awards and at the 24th Seoul Music Awards .

It is composed of three Girls' Generation members: Taeyeon , Tiffany , and Seohyun . The sub-group has released three extended plays: Twinkle , Holler , and Dear Santa . During the year 2012, South Korean girl group Girls' Generation went through an unannounced hiatus as the majority of the group's members were focusing on individual activities. Some acted in television dramas while others participated in various television programs. The subgroup TTS was born because members Taeyeon, Tiffany, and Seohyun wanted to carry on with their music activities. All three were hosts of the weekly music program Show! Music Core at the time. On April 19, 2012, SM Entertainment officially announced the formation of the subgroup and hinted at the possibility of other future subgroups, explaining, \"the members of the unit [are rotated] according to the [unique] music and concept of each new subgroup album.\" Compared to Girls' Generation, TTS's main focus is on each member's vocal ability while the original group places more emphasis on the overall songs and uniform group performances. The name \"TaeTiSeo\" or \"TTS\", is made up of the first syllables of Taeyeon, Tiffany, and Seohyun. Their debut EP, Twinkle , was released on April 29, 2012. It was the first album by a Korean artist to rank number 1 on the Billboard World Albums chart. At the time, it was also the highest charting K-pop album on the Billboard 200 , reaching number 126. The title track of the same name sold 2,520,485 digital copies in South Korea as of July 2014, and the album has sold 155,521 copies in South Korea. TTS became the first subgroup to achieve a \"triple crown\" on South Korean music shows , reigning in the number 1 spot for three weeks in a row.

    rdfs:label "Highlight_group" ;
    dbo:abstract """ Highlight ( Korean : 하이라이트 ) is a South Korean boy band formerly known as Beast ( Korean : 비스트). The band consists of four members: Yoon Doo-joon , Yang Yo-seob , Lee Gi-kwang , and Son Dong-woon . Original member Jang Hyun-seung officially left the group in April 2016, and Yong Jun-hyung left in March 2019. In late 2016, the group moved labels from Cube Entertainment to Around Us Entertainment and subsequently changed their name to Highlight in 2017. As Beast, the group released three Korean full-length albums , nine Korean mini-albums , two Japanese full-length albums, and numerous singles . The group debuted in 2009 with the mini-album, Beast Is the B2ST . In 2011, they released their first full-length album, Fiction and Fact , and made their Japanese debut with the single, " Shock" (Japanese Version) . As Highlight, the group debuted in 2017 with the mini-album, Can You Feel It? . Beast initially received attention for the lack of industry success previously experienced by its members, with media outlets referring to them as "a group of recycled material." However, the group has achieved significant commercial success and critical accolades and is one of the most awarded groups of all time at the Golden Disk Awards , the Seoul Music Awards , and the Melon Music Awards . Prior to their debut, Korean news outlets reported that Cube Entertainment would be releasing a new boy group known as "B2ST", an abbreviation for "Boys to Search for Top" pronounced as "Beast". The name was changed to "Beast" before their debut, but the group retains the original stylisation in all their promotional material. In October 2009, Beast held their debut showcase at the MTV GongGae Hall and made their live performance debut on KBS Music Bank with their debut single, "Bad Girl". A documentary recording the story of the group's debut titled "MTV B2ST" was filmed during this time, showing the members as they filmed their first music video and bonded with each other. Their debut mini-album, Beast is the B2ST featured five songs, including the intro track "Beast is the B2ST," "Mystery," and "Oasis." The song "Yet" ( 아직은 , Ajigeun ) was banned from airplay due to swearing in Jun-hyung's rap. Beast won their first award, Rookie of the Month for December, awarded by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism . In early 2010, Beast promoted their second single, "Mystery," from the mini-album. The members created their own humorous amateur music video for the song, featuring fellow Korean pop singers including members of Girls' Generation and Kara . The mini-album went on to sell 40,000 copies, an unusual feat for a Korean rookie group, with the album's original print run of 20,000 copies selling out in its first month. In January 2010, Beast and their labelmates, girl group 4minute , signed with worldwide album company Universal Music Group for their international promotions and album launches and began their first international promotions in Taiwan with 4minute. The group was awarded the Best Newcomer Award alongside girl groups T-ara and After School at the 19th Seoul Music Awards in February 2010. Beast released their second mini-album Shock of the New Era in March 2010 with the lead single "Shock." The group achieved their first number-one win on Mnet ’s M! Countdown with "Shock." The album quickly sold 20,000 copies in Korea and was certified into the Gold Disk category in Singapore. Reviews of the title track described it as having both powerful vocals and a rock-influenced strong sound, a departure from the pop feel of their debut single, and praised the complex choreography for the track in live performances. During the promotion period for "Shock," the group performed an orchestra version of Korean group Noel's ballad "Despite Holding On" ( 붙잡고도 , Butjapgodo ) and was recognized as a boy group with outstanding singing ability. A digital single version of their track "Easy" from their Shock of the New Era album was released in April 2010 with the title "Easy (Sincere Ver.)." The track used strings and piano as opposed to the hip-hop feel and electronic instruments of the original. In August 2010, Beast received the Golden Disk Award from Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand at the '2010 Summer CUBE Stars Party' in Seoul. Beast and 4minute also became the first Korean artists to be invited to perform on the Singapore Youth Olympics pre-opening stage. The group was awarded with the Cool Star Award in the 2010 Mnet 20's Choice Awards. American R&B musician Omarion made a surprise appearance as a guest onstage with the group as they received their award. Omarion had earlier invited Beast to perform with him after viewing a YouTube clip of the group delivering a dance performance of his single " Ice Box ". On September 17, 2010, Beast released the song "Jumeogeul Kkwak Jwigo” (주먹을 꽉 쥐고, lit. Clenching a Tight Fist) as a single from their third mini-album, Mastermind . The song gained anticipation and attention from the public for the excellent vocal ability they displayed. Mastermind was released on September 28, 2010. On October 8, 2010, a week after their comeback, Beast claimed first place on KBS Music Bank with the song "Soom” (숨, lit. Breath) from Mastermind . The song was noted for its original sound and distinctive choreography. On October 23, 2010, Beast is one of the recipient of the Asia Influential Artist Award which is given to those who had gained the most attention in Asia for the year.

fadm:Jewelry a schema:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Jewelry" ;
    dbo:abstract "Jewelry ( Korean : 쥬얼리 ) was a South Korean girl group formed in 2001 by Star Empire Entertainment . The group was the longest-running Korean girl group (with more than 2 members) until their disbandment in 2015, surpassing super-group Baby V.O.X. Jewelry founding members Park Jung-ah , Lee Ji-hyun , Jun Eun-mi and Jung Yoo-jin debuted in 2001 with their first album Discovery . After less-than-stellar sales of the first album, two of the singers (Jun Eun-mi and Jung Yoo-jin) were replaced by Seo In-young and Cho Min-ah. A year later, their second album, Again , was released, with much better results. Full of strong R&B ballads (as opposed to the sexy dance songs that were popular at that time), the album quickly yielded two high-charting singles — \"Again\" and \"Tonight\" — which started the group's rise to popularity. This was quickly followed by their third album Beloved , which had a very cutesy theme. Their first single \"니가 참 좋아\" (\"I Really Like You\") was very poppy and had Jewelry adopt a cutesy concept to match the song, with colorful outfits and perky dances. The title track, Be My Love , was also promoted. Even though album sales for Again and Beloved were great, the group was unhappy with their current image, and did not want to be known for only their cute and innocent songs. After the success of their second album, Jewelry left for Japan to start on their career there in 2004 with their first single Kokoro ga Tomaranai under the independent label Giza Studio . After releasing a few materials there with mediocre sales, the group eventually left to return to their native country to release their fourth album. By the time their fourth album Superstar came out in the beginning of 2005, Jewelry has since shed their \"cute image\" concept. Following the trend in Korean pop , they became sexier and more womanly, which helped bring about their current level of success. The first single \"Superstar\" (written by Shinhwa member Lee Min-woo ) was a driven rock song and surprisingly became a huge hit. They followed this up with the sexy R&B number \"Passion\", which also charted strongly. Both of these singles prominently featured \"sexy\" member Seo In-Young dance scantily-clad in short shorts, which brought the group much press attention (both positive and negative). In 2006, Jewelry took a break from the Korean music industry in order to focus on Japan. During that time, member Ji-hyun left to pursue an acting career. In early November, news leaked out that another member, Cho Min-ah , had also left, which forced their record company to look for a second replacement member. As Park Jung-Ah and Seo In-young had solo projects, a new album was not expected until mid-2007. In early 2008, Jewelry returned to the music scene with their new members Baby J and Eunjung with the release of their fifth album, Kitchi Island . Released on February 20, 2008, the album featured the single \"One More Time\", a cover of In-Grid 's song, composed by Sannie Carlson ( Whigfield ). \"One More Time\" has mirrored the success of Jewelry's 2005 hit single, \"Superstar\" in South Korea, reaching the No. 1 spot on MBC's Music Core and KBS's Music Bank , two weeks after the song's debut. The single has also achieved success online, topping the charts of various music websites, including Melon, Dosirak, Bugs Music, M.Net.com, Muz and Juke On. \"One More Time\" became the most successful single of Jewelry to date, staying on the no.1 spot for 7 weeks in a row on MBC's Music Core and KBS's Music Bank . In spring of 2008, a second single, \"모두 다 쉿\" (\" Everybody Shh! \"), was released and promoted. The group was awarded with a Daesang (대상, a \"Top Award\"), for highest digital sales in 2008. In early 2009, members Baby J and Eunjung returned to the Korean music market, under the name \"Jewelry S\", debuting as a sub-group. Their mini-album, Sweet Song was released in digital format on January 22, and the full single was made available on February 6. Baby J and Eunjung made their live comeback on M. Countdown on February 5, where they sang \"들어봐\" ( \"Listen\" ) and the lead single from their mini-album, \"데이트\" ( \"Date\" ). The music video for \"Date\" features cameo appearances from Jewelry members Park Jung-ah and Seo In-young. Jewelry released a new single in June 2009 titled \"Super Star\" with the song \"Rally\" featuring rapper Nassun. The song was for MNet's talent competition, Superstar K . A music video was also released and featured the group's performance of the song on Mnet's M! Countdown as well as scenes of Superstar K. About a week prior to the album release, the song \"Strong Girl\" was released as a digital single. Their 6th album, Sophisticated , was released on August 27 with the music video for the title track, \"Vari2ty\", being released on the same day. In December 2009 Seo In-young and Park Jung-ah announced their departure. Korean media reported that Superstar K top 10 contender Semi was likely to replace them. A repackaged edition of their 6th album, End And.. was released on December 17, 2009 with the single \"Love Story\". On June 14, 2010, it was announced Semi would be joining Jewelry with a comeback happening later during the year. A few months later it was announced the groups comeback would occur in 2011. On January 18, 2011, Kim Ye-won joined Jewelry. A digital single, \"Back It Up\" was released on January 27 along with its accompanying music video. They made their comeback performance during the same day on M! Countdown . The single reached a certain amount of success however it was not as successful as their previous works. On May 9, Jewelry's label, Star Empire Entertainment, shared some old videos of Jewelry rehearsing various songs. Two days later they announced with teaser photos the group would release a new single which was later revealed to be \"Pass\". The single was released on May 16 along with a teaser MV featuring label mate Hwang Kwang Hee of ZE:A . No music video was released for \"Pass\". On September, Semi and Yewon joined the sub-unit Jewelry S and announced they would release a single entitled \"Ames Room Vol.2\", the title track being the song \"Forget It\". The single was released on September 20, and the music video was released the same day. Yewon joined the hit variety show Invincible Youth 2 to represent her group. The show started on November 17, 2011 and ended on November 12, 2012. In 2012, Jewelry was originally scheduled to make a comeback in July. However, this was delayed until October. On September 21, Jewelry announced their comeback with their first mini album \"Look At Me\", with the title track as the same name. The mini album was released on October 11. \"Look At Me\" debuted at #42 on the Gaon Digital Charts and later peaked at #23. The mini album also debuted at #7 on the Gaon National Physical Album Charts. The music video was also released during the same day and the group had their comeback performance on Music Bank the next day. During mid November, Jewelry was announced to release a digital single around early December. But towards the end of November, Star Empire Entertainment, announced the digital single was postponed and the group would spend more time preparing for their next release. In 2013, Star Empire announced that Jewelry will release a digital single in July called \"Hot & Cold\". On March 3, 2014, it was revealed that Eunjung's contract had expired and she would be leaving the group. Yewon was cast in the weekend drama Hotel King , in the role of an enthusiastic front desk officer. On April 17, 2014, Yewon hosted the Mnet talk show M Countdown Begins with K.Will . Meanwhile, Semi starred in a new sitcom, Boarding House no 24 as Park Semi. On November 19, 2014, Baby J revealed that she will be leaving Jewelry as her contract expired last August. It was also revealed that Semi would not be renewing her contract after it expired that month. On January 7, 2015, the group was officially confirmed as disbanded. On April 8, 2018, members Baby J, Eunjung, Inyoung and Jungah reunited on the JTBC 's show Sugarman 2 , where they performed their 2008 single One More Time . " ;

    dbo:abstract " Ladies' Code ( Korean : 레이디스 코드 ) is a South Korean girl group formed by Polaris Entertainment in 2013. The group's original lineup consisted of leader Ashley and members RiSe , EunB, Sojung , and Zuny. They made their debut with the mini-album Code#01 and the lead track \"Bad Girl\", which were released on March 7, 2013. On September 3, 2014, the group was involved in a car crash that resulted in the deaths of EunB and RiSe. Ladies' Code returned as a trio in February 2016 with the extended play Myst3ry . In October 2016, they issued \"The Rain\" from their EP Strang3r . The group left Polaris in February 2020 following the expiration of their contracts. Before the establishment of the group, most of the members had some experience in the entertainment industry. Rise participated in Miss Korea 2009 as a representative of Japan, and won the Korean Abroad Award. She gained popularity by starring in the talent show called Star Audition: The Great Birth , and finished in the Top 12. She then appeared with fellow Star Audition contestant David Oh as a couple on the reality show We Got Married in 2011. Rise later signed on with KeyEast before switching agencies in 2013. EunB was previously a trainee under FNC Entertainment, where she was in the original line-up for AOA . However, she left the company prior to the group's debut because she felt she needed more experience as a trainee. Sojung was a finalist and finished in the top eight of the first season of The Voice of Korea . Ashley, prior to her debut, was known for uploading dance covers of K-pop songs to YouTube and for being a former trainee under Cube Entertainment. [ citation needed ] Zuny was mainly known for being a former trainee under BigHit Entertainment. [ citation needed ] In 2012, Ladies' Code started recording their debut album. On February 20, 2013, Sojung confirmed that she would join a new girl group being formed by Polaris Entertainment , and that they would debut in the following month. Promotion began on February 25, 2013, with the release of RiSe's teaser video, followed by Sojung's on the 26th, EunB's on the 27th, for Zuny's on the 28th, and March 1 for leader Ashley respectively. On March 4, 2013, they released the group teaser for their music video. The group's debut mini-album Code#01 along with the title song \"Bad Girl\" and accompanying music video was released on March 7, 2013. The day after their debut, their song charted well on the real-time music charts including Bugs, Soribada, Mnet and Daum, and eventually peaked at number 34 on the Gaon Digital Chart . They had their first live performance on M! Countdown the same day of the release with the group concluding promotions on Inkigayo on April 21, 2013. Their first digital single \" Hate You \" was released on August 6, 2013, serving as a pre-release for their upcoming second mini-album. The group's return was originally set for July 25, 2013 however member Zuny had an unexpected leg injury which pushed back their comeback until August. The song debuted high on the real-time charts, achieving their first number-one single on Bugs Music and charting within the top 10 in four other music charts. On August 21, 2013, Ladies' Code announced their comeback for their second mini-album, Code#02 Pretty Pretty , which was released on September 5, 2013. Polaris Entertainment announced on February 4, 2014 that the group would make a comeback with their second digital single \"So Wonderful.\" A still-cut of the first music video teaser was released on February 6, 2014 showing member Kwon Rise lying in transparent plastic wrap. The teaser was subsequently released online the following day with the second teaser on February 10. The song was produced by Super Changddai who worked with the group since their debut. The single along with its accompanying music video was released on February 13, 2014, with the group performing the song for the first time on M! Countdown the same day. On July 31, 2014, Ladies' Code revealed a teaser image of their new single \"Kiss Kiss\" and released a video teaser the following day. A second video teaser featuring all of the members recreating kiss scenes such as the fairy tale \" The Frog Prince \" was released on August 5, 2014. On August 6, 2014, the music video for \"Kiss Kiss\" was released online and the single was released on August 7, 2014. A limited edition CD single for \"Kiss Kiss\" was also released. The group began promotions for the song on KBS's Music Bank the following day. On September 1, 2014, Ashley revealed that the group was in the midst of working on a new album, though whether it was a mini-album or full-length album is unknown. On September 3, 2014 at around 1:30AM ( KST ), the group was involved in a serious car collision while returning to Seoul after attending the recording of KBS \"Open Concert\" at DGIST . The group's manager, Mr. Park, was driving the van and had been speeding, driving 137 km/h (85 mph) in a 100 km/h (62 mph) zone for a distance of 30 km (19 mi). Rainy conditions made the road slippery, which caused Park to suddenly lose control of the vehicle, causing the group's van to hydroplane and skid several times before crashing into a protective wall in the vicinity of the Singal Junction on Yeongdong Expressway . EunB was declared dead on arrival by the time the paramedics reached Sungbin Medical Center, while the remaining six passengers were rushed to various hospitals. Sojung and RiSe, who suffered the most serious injuries, were taken to the Catholic University of Korea St. Vincent's Hospital in Suwon , listed under critical condition. RiSe's condition quickly deteriorated and she was moved to Ajou University Hospital, where she eventually died four days later on September 7, 2014, at 10:10AM ( KST ). Sojung's condition was stabilized. Ashley, Zuny, Park, and one stylist also sustained minor injuries. On October 29, Ashley and Zuny were released from the hospital and spent time recovering at their respective homes, while Sojung was moved to a hospital in her hometown of Wonju . They returned to their group's dorm in Seoul on November 12, with Sojung continuing to receive outpatient treatment. The investigation conducted by the National Institute of Scientific Investigation (NISI), revealed and confirmed that the cause of the collision was due to driving over the posted speed limit and that the van's back tire came off due to the impact of the van crashing into the protective wall. It had been reported that none of the van's airbags deployed at the time of impact, while witness accounts state that the vehicle rolled over multiple times after it hit the protective wall. An ambulance worker who was at the scene later reported that he did \"not recall undoing any seat belts\" as he attempted to help the injured passengers. In the wake of EunB and RiSe's deaths, the group would go on to achieve major success on the music charts as fans of the group began posting messages on online communities and SNS encouraging people to listen to the song \"I'm Fine Thank You\" (from the group's second EP Pretty Pretty ) as a tribute and to fulfill EunB's dream of ranking first on the music charts. The song would eventually top several real-time music charts including Melon, Bugs, Genie, Monkey3, and Olleh, also peaking at number three on the Gaon Singles Chart , making it their highest charting single. Both \"I'm Fine Thank You\" and \"Kiss Kiss\" would also go on to debut at number six and number 21 on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, marking the group's first two entries on the chart. The group's final performance with all five members aired on KBS on September 14, 2014, bookended with a tribute to EunB and RiSe. On September 15, 2014, Polaris Entertainment released a tribute music video of \"I'm Fine Thank You\", using behind-the-scenes footage of the group to honor EunB and RiSe. On November 12, 2014, Park was arrested and indicted on the charge of causing a fatal collision under the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Settlement of Traffic Accidents and was sentenced to a year and two months in jail on January 15, 2015. On March 25, 2015, Park filed an appeal to reduce his sentence. On April 8, 2015, he reached a settlement agreement with both EunB and RiSe's families for an undisclosed amount. On April 15, 2015, Park's appeal was successful, and his sentence was reduced to a suspended one year and two months jail sentence for a period of two years. He was also required to do 160 hours of community service and attend 40 hours of law-abiding driving classes. On April 26, 2015, it was reported that Zuny, Ashley, and Sojung had resumed their practice schedule while continuing to receive counseling and follow-up treatments for injuries sustained from the crash. Ladies' Code held a memorial concert named \"I'm Fine, Thank You: RiSe & EunB Memorial Concert\" on August 22, 2015, at the Shinagawa Stellar-ball in Tokyo, Japan, in honor of RiSe's dream that Ladies' Code would someday perform in her home country. The concert featured Polaris artists, including Kim Bum-soo and Rumble Fish , and a performance of \"I'll Smile Even If It Hurts\" by Ashley, Sojung, and Zuny. Sojung was involved in the track's composition and production. On September 3, 2015, Sojung and Polaris artists Kim Bum-soo, IVY , Han Hee-jun , Rumble Fish, and Sun Woo released a cover of \"I'm Fine, Thank You\" in memory of EunB and RiSe. A Polaris representative stated that all proceeds from the song would be donated to charity. Ladies' Code members released \"I'll Smile Even If It Hurts\" as digital single on September 7, 2015, the first anniversary of RiSe's death. On January 23, 2016, Ladies' Code was revealed to be preparing for a comeback in the spring, their first comeback since the crash and as a trio. Polaris Entertainment noted the end of February as a tentative comeback date and clarified that there were no future plans to recruit new members. The album named Myst3ry with its title track \"Galaxy\" was released on February 24, 2016. On October 13, 2016, Ladies' Code released their single album Strang3r along with the title track \"The Rain\". On May 4, 2017, Sojung released a solo song named \"Better than Me\", and later released another solo single, \"Stay Here\" on March 8, 2018. Ashley made her solo debut on July 17, 2018, with the single \"Here We Are\". On December 12, 2018, the group released a Christmas single \"The Last Holiday\", making it their first release in two years as a group. In May 2019, Ladies' Code released a single titled \"Feedback\". On October 10, 2019, Ladies' Code released their fourth album Code#03 Set Me Free , their third from the \"Code\" series. This album was released six years after Code#02 Pretty Pretty . The lead single for their fourth album is called \"Set Me Free\", and was written by 1Take and TAK. On February 17, 2020, Ladies' Code left Polaris Entertainment following the expiration of their contracts with the label. The group is currently on indefinite hiatus, with the members pursuing solo careers. Ladies' Code signed their first deal with Pepsi Korea in August 2013 as the company's next models for their 'Open Your Pepsi Now' campaign. In January 2014, the group teamed up with Nexon to promote the winter update for the MMORPG Mabinogi Heroes . Prior to the crash, Ladies' Code's music had been predominantly pop with a retro sound. Billboard magazine noted that the group blends in \"modern electro-pop \" with \"classic throwback elements\" and powerful vocals. The group's debut single \"Bad Girl\" was described as a swing/jazz-inspired track accompanied with solid vocals. Their follow-up single, \" Hate You \" was marked as a departure, returning with a mid-tempo dance song with a combination of brass and acoustic guitar arrangements. Subsequent releases retain their earlier style with Corynn Smith of MTV Iggy explaining their second extended play's title track \"Pretty Pretty\" as another example of the group's \"rich retro sound\", moving from 40s swing to a mixture of 70s and 80s beats. In an interview with enews on their digital single \" So Wonderful \", member Ashley explained the song was a continuation of their previous releases but added that they had incorporated the use of more instruments and were going for a \"retro feeling from the 80's.\" Their first release after the crash, Myst3ry , shifted into an R&B sound with the lead single \"Galaxy\" described as a \"mid-tempo song that invokes a gloomy and dreamlike mood\". Ladies' Code have cited the Brown Eyed Girls and Wonder Girls as their role models, the latter compared to the group by media outlets due to their similar style of music and image. In September 2013, Wonder Girls' member Sunye posted a message on Twitter supporting the group, saying how \"Pretty Pretty\" reminded her on their group's past releases \" Tell Me \" and \" So Hot \".

    dbo:abstract " Momoland ( Korean : 모모랜드 ) is a South Korean girl group formed by MLD Entertainment (formerly known as Duble Kick Company ) through the 2016 reality show Finding Momoland . The show winners became the seven members Hyebin, Yeonwoo, Jane, Nayun, JooE, Ahin, and Nancy, and they debuted on November 10, 2016, with the EP Welcome to Momoland . In 2017, Momoland added two new members, Daisy and Taeha. In 2019, Taeha and Yeonwoo left the group. In June 2016, Mnet 's survival program Finding Momoland began, a reality show that was created by Duble Kick Entertainment where a group of seven members were selected from 10 trainees. It was decided that the members were going to make their debut, but the Final Mission could not collect 3,000 spectators, so the official debut was delayed for a while to prepare for their debut, promotional events, fan meetings, and the street. On October 26, 2016, the group was appointed as ambassadors for the International Relief Development NGO Plan Korea. The group's debut showcase was held on November 9 of the same year. On November 10, they released their debut extended play Welcome to Momoland and made their debut through M Countdown . Their first debut album is made possible by crowdfunding to cover the cost for producing the physical album. On December 27, six members except Yeonwoo, who stopped working due to lower back pain, attended SBS Gayo Daejeon . In October 2016, Momoland, appointed as the PR ambassador for the International Relief Development NGO Plan Korea, volunteered at the Phuc Luong Village in Thai Nguyen, Vietnam from December 12 to 16, 2017, to encourage Happy Mov students to participate in Kindergarten construction service. On March 28, 2017, Daisy and Taeha joined the group, increasing the group to nine members. In April 2017, the group had a comeback with their digital single \"Wonderful Love\". On August 22, 2017, they released their second EP, Freeze! , with the title track \"Freeze\". On January 3, 2018, they made a comeback with their third EP, Great! with the title track \" Bboom Bboom \". The same month, Serebro accused Momoland of plagiarizing their song \" Mi Mi Mi \" with \"Bboom Bboom\". The composer of \"Bboom Bboom\", Shinsadong Tiger, denied the allegations by pointing out that \"the bass line [is] commonly heard in retro house or electro swing genres, as well as the 4-stanza chord.\" Momoland held promotional events in Tokyo and Osaka from February 28 until March 4, 2018. The group garnered 25,000 spectators at an event held in Japan over four days. Approximately 100 media also participated in the showcase held at Tower Records in Shibuya . Momoland also signed with King Records and debuted in Japan on June 13, 2018, with a Japanese version of their single \"Bboom Bboom\". On June 26, 2018, they released their fourth EP titled Fun to the World with the title track \" Baam \". On August 9, 2018, Momoland became the first girl group – and the second act – to earn a Platinum certification by Gaon Music Chart , for over 100 million streams for the song \"Bboom Bboom\". On March 20, 2019, Momoland released their fifth EP titled Show Me with the lead single \"I'm So Hot\", which became their first release without Daisy and Taeha since Welcome to Momoland . On September 4, 2019, Momoland released their first Japanese studio album Chiri Chiri without Daisy, Taeha and Yeonwoo. On October 4, 2019, the group and MLD Entertainment signed a co-management agreement with the Philippine media corporation ABS-CBN . In late 2019, MLD Entertainment annonced Yeonwoo and Taeha's departure through the group's official fan cafe, and stated that they were still in discussions with Daisy about her future. On December 30, 2019, Momoland released their first single album Thumbs Up with the lead single of the same name. Adapted from their Naver profile. " ;

    dbo:abstract "Pristin ( Korean : 프리스틴 ; stylized as PRISTIN and formerly known as Pledis Girlz ) was a South Korean girl group formed by Pledis Entertainment in 2016. The group was composed of ten members: Nayoung , Roa, Yuha, Eunwoo, Rena, Kyulkyung , Yehana, Sungyeon, Xiyeon and Kyla. Most of them appeared on the television show Produce 101 and, as the prize for becoming two of the top contestants, Nayoung and Kyulkyung went on to debut as part of the project girl group I.O.I , before reuniting with the other members to debut as Pristin on March 21, 2017, with the first EP Hi! Pristin . Pristin was known for writing and composing their own music. The group disbanded on May 24, 2019. The members Nayoung , Roa, Yuha, Eunwoo, Rena, Kyulkyung and Xiyeon competed together on Mnet 's survival television show Produce 101 , which aired from January 22 to April 1, 2016. While five of the members were eliminated , Nayoung and Kyulkyung became part of the final line-up for the project girl group I.O.I , which made its debut on May 4 with the single \" Dream Girls \". The group was officially announced as Pledis Girlz by Pledis Entertainment on March 23, 2016. On the same day, Eunwoo was featured on the song \"Sickness\" by Seventeen 's Vernon as part of the soundtrack for the webtoon Love Revolution . Pledis Girlz held concerts from May 14 to September 10, 2016, in which the members performed weekly, with the exception of Nayoung and Kyulkyung, who were promoting with I.O.I at the time. On June 27, they released the promotional single \" We \", which was written by Roa, Eunwoo, Sungyeon and Xiyeon. The music video for the song was used to introduce the members' profiles. They held their last concert as Pledis Girlz, entitled Bye & Hi , on January 6, 2017, and then renamed to Pristin, a portmanteau of the words \" prismatic \" (bright and clear) and \" elastin \" (flawless strength). On March 2, 2017, Pledis Entertainment announced the group's debut through a teaser image. On March 21, Pristin debuted and released their first mini album Hi! Pristin , accompanied by the title track \" Wee Woo \". They became the first rookie girl group to perform their debut song on a live broadcast during Mnet Present. Pristin was also part of the line-up for the KCON festival held in Japan on May 19. On the same day, a remixed version of \" Black Widow \" was released as the album's second and final single, which was performed on a few music shows in order to conclude Hi Pristin 's promotions. On June 3, they performed at the 2017 Dream Concert at the Seoul World Cup Stadium . Their second mini album Schxxl Out was released on August 23, along with the single \" We Like \". On October 12, it was announced that Kyla would take a break from the group's activities due to health issues. She returned temporarily to the United States to focus on her recovery. On May 8, 2018, it was announced that Pristin would be debuting a sub-unit called Pristin V , consisting of members Nayoung, Roa, Eunwoo, Rena and Kyulkyung. Pristin V made their debut on May 28, 2018 with single album Like A V . On May 24, 2019, Pristin was officially disbanded. Pledis Entertainment announced that while Kyulkyung, Yehana, and Sungyeon would stay with the company, the remaining seven (Xiyeon, Rena, Roa, Kyla, Nayoung, Yuha, and Eunwoo) would be departing. " ;

fadm:RaNia a schema:Class ;
    rdfs:label "RaNia" ;
    dbo:abstract " Rania ( Korean : 라니아 ; shortened from \"Regeneration Idol of Asia\"), formerly known as BP Rania (shortened from \"Black Pearl Rania\") is a South Korean girl group formed by DR Music in 2011, created by American Teddy Riley . They debuted as Rania with their debut single album Teddy Riley, The First Expansion In Asia with title track \"Dr Feel Good\" released in April 2011. Rania was originally set to debut in mid 2010 as the third generation of Baby V.O.X. , however their record company DR Music decided to rebrand them as a new group named Rania with eight members: Saem (later known as Yina), Lucy (later known as Jooyi), Riko, Joy, Di, T-ae, Xia and Sarah. T-ae, Riko and Yina were chosen to star alongside former 2PM member Jay Park in his movie Hype Nation, causing DR Music to push back the group's debut. At the beginning of 2011, Sarah Wang made her decision to leave the group and was replaced by Chinese trainee Yijo. Before the addition of Yijo, Thai Korean trainee Data (Song Daeun) and Canadian Korean trainee Minhee (Moon Minhee) were set to take Sarah's place. However, Minhee left due to parental disapproval due to her age (at the time she was 15), and Data left due to homesickness (her family resided in Thailand). Rania made their debut in April 2011 as an eight-member group, consisting of Saem, Jooyi, Riko, Joy, Di, T-ae, Xia and Yijo. However, upon their debut EP's release, Yijo was not present for live performances. It was later revealed that Yijo was having issues with her work visa. She left the group shortly after. On April 6 they performed on KBS ' Music Bank , with the title track \"Dr Feel Good\", composed by producer Teddy Riley . The song was originally given to Lady Gaga . However, since their music video and live performances caused controversy in Korea as some viewers felt that their image and concept were too provocative, Rania were forced to change their choreography and make minor changes to the outfits. After the conclusion of \"Dr Feel Good\" promotions, the group returned in June with their first digital single \"Masquerade\" (also composed by Riley). Despite having planned an American debut, the group made no advancements. Shortly afterwards Riley announced that he would have nothing more to do with the group after falling out with their record label, releasing a statement saying \"I wish them the best. It's not the girls I dislike, I love Rania, they would be better with me at SM Entertainment. Their manager does shady business, used me for my music. I love Rania, I just don't like their company business. That's why they are not getting bigger. They don't do business upfront. They used my name every where then back door me on the group. It's ok if they will regret it. If they leave that company, I will sign them up quickly. Please know the facts before attacking me. Attack their company. Such great talent will be wasted if they don't get better support.\" The group released their second EP, Time to Rock Da Show , on November 16, 2011. The music video for its title track, \"Pop Pop Pop\", written by Brave Brothers , was revealed four days later. Joy suddenly went on hiatus at this time, which DR Music claimed was because her parents' house had been affected in the flood which occurred in Thailand at the time of the release, and later left Rania in June 2012. In a series of now-deleted tweets, she wrote \"To everyone, I'm sorry I let you guys down so many times, but I’ve been thinking about it for months. I think I can't go back to stand on that place anymore. [...] I can't go back anymore. Thanks for all of your love and all of your hope, thank you so much and I feel so sorry that I [am disappointing beloved fans]…From now…I think I can't be in the entertainment [industry] or back to be a singer anymore since I was sick…But I haven't got any confidence to go back to do it. I'm sorry that I made you all have to wait for me…and I made you all feel confused. Thank you so much for gifts, kindness, love that you give me. Thank you.\" On 30 May 2012, Rania performed a new song named \"Killer\" at the Dream Concert. They made a comeback on September 16 with second digital single \"Style\", whose music video was revealed on September 20. Jooyi did not participate in this comeback, although DR Music claimed she was still a member of the group. Rania released the lead single \"Just Go\" on March 8, 2013, along with their third mini album, also titled Just Go (Goodbye's The New Hello) . They also announced to debut in America in summer 2013. Empire Records was to be handling the girls' distribution while Fireworks was to handle their American management. Larry Rudolph and Adam Leber , two of Britney Spears ' managers, decided to be Rania's managers throughout their U.S. promotions. Starting May 21, Rania began filming for their MTV reality show Road to Fame in Los Angeles and other cities across the U.S. The show would feature the group's preparations for their U.S. debut and would air for three months. It was also revealed that the album would feature collaborations with both Snoop Dogg and 2 Chainz . However, Rania's American debut was delayed again in June. Instead, they began to film a CF for Woongjin Waterpark Play°C and released a special digital single titled \"Up\" for fans on July 5. In May 2014, the group signed with Spanish label INGENIOmedia and confirmed they would have a comeback in July with \"Acceleration\", with a second round of promotions in September. The label also confirmed that they were looking for a sixth member to replace Riko, who was absent from the group since \"Just Go\". Following an incident where a staffer at INGENIOmedia leaked Rania's comeback track to a sasaeng fan , the company severed ties with the group, stating they were \"taking too long\". INGENIOMedia later released a statement saying that they were not looking for a member to replace Riko, apologizing for any confusion, and said that any news on member changes would have to come from Rania's company. In late 2014, Saem stopped attending public events and deactivated her official social media accounts. This led to intense fan speculation that she had left the group, but DR Music did not release an official statement regarding her situation. Soon afterwards, DR Music announced Riko's departure, releasing a statement saying: \"After the completion of the promotions of the single \"Style\", Riko told us with that she would take her university entrance exams to study a career, she asked for a three year break to complete her university studies and once she graduated from college, she could return to the group as a member of RaNia, but the problem came back this year when she reproached subjects in the university, she made us aware of this situation and asked for a year more absence that we found impossible since although she promotes or not with the group, we as a company should continue paying a normal salary, And That is unfair for us and the other members of the group, because she can not postpone her absence anymore, she decided to leave the group and the agency.\" DR Music later added a new member, Sharon Park, who was a model before joining the group. In January 2015, Jooyi stopped attending live performances with RaNia. When asked for an update on the situation, DR Music claimed that she was simply on hiatus. In April 2015, Sharon Park left the group to focus on her modeling career. In July 2015, the group made their appearance with two new members, trainees Seulji and Hyeme. In October 2015, they were announced to be having a comeback as a six-member group on November 6 with their third EP Demonstrate . On 3 November, Seulji and Hyeme were revealed as new members and it was announced that Demonstrate would feature African-American rapper Alexandra Reid, with the possibility of her becoming a new member of the group. On November 4, DR Music confirmed that Alexandra Reid had joined the group, while confirming Saem and Jooyi's departures. Alex is the first African-American woman to be an official member of a South Korean girl group. DR Music sent out a letter to fans that supported their Makestar project, informing them that RaNia's comeback had been pushed back to August 2016, and they were working on a Hyeme & Alex sub-unit instead. On July 13, 2016, however, Makestar announced that due to repeated failed attempts to contact DR Music about the project's progress and \"the continued irresponsible behavior and stance taken by the RaNia project creator, and our unwillingness to ignore the inconvenience this is causing to the project participants\", the project would be terminated and all money returned to the fans. On May 26, it was confirmed that the last three original members of RaNia - Di, T-ae and Xia had withdrawn from the group and parted ways from DR Music after five years. They then signed with their new label Enter Hama, where they announced their plans to redebute as \"Ela8te\", although these plans fell through. On June 26, RaNia performed at a Chinese event with three DR Music trainees: Jian, Jieun (a former member of LPG ) and Crystal. On August 15, 2016, Alex announced that she was the group's new leader. On October 25, RaNia performed with two DR Music trainees (Ttabo and Hyeonji) at the 2016 Seoul ICARUS Drone International Film Festival. Two days later DR Music stated that from seven DR Music trainees they would choose new RaNia members. On December 23, 2016, DR Music revealed a teaser image for \"BP RaNia\" (\"Black Pearl\" RaNia, in reference to Alex's darker skintone) and hinted a comeback as a seven-member group. On December 24, an image teaser for Hyeme and new member Jieun were revealed. On 25 December, Zi.U (formerly known as Seulji) and new member Yumin teaser images were revealed. On December 26, DR Music revealed teaser images for Alex and new Chinese member Ttabo. It was reported that former member Saem had rejoined the group after two years following her departure in late 2014, and that she had changed her stage name to Yina. On December 27, DR Music revealed last teaser image for Saem, confirming that she had re-joined the group. On December 28, RaNia released their first teaser music video for their upcoming comeback track \"Start a Fire\" as BP RaNia. \"Start a Fire\" was released on December 30, 2016, along with their fourth EP of the same name. DR Music said \"Through Spanish company INGENIOmedia, the song will be available in more than 60 countries around the world.\" On February 10 2017, DR Music announced that BP RaNia would start promotions for their second song \"Make Me Ah\" from the Start a Fire EP, on February 14. It was also announced that this would be the first time that Alex would take part in the entire choreography. On February 21, DR Music revealed that the company was approached by a well established production company with an acting opportunity for Alex, to which they responded by releasing a statement saying that they hoped that fans could understand the benefits of this opportunity, and that the opportunity would \"allow the group to gain exposure and help BP RaNia's success by expanding their fan base.\" DR Music assured the fans that Alex would remain a fully active member of BP RaNia, and would return to her regular schedules after her return to Korea. The company asked people to send positivity to Alex and to wait patiently and enthusiastically for their return. On February 28, RaNia released their first compilation album RaNia Legends , comprising songs from \"Dr Feel Good\" to \"Start a Fire\". On May 12, DR Music announced that they were looking for three to four new members to start BP RaNia W, a worldwide group that would promote alongside the current members of BP RaNia. Near the end of March fans noticed that Yina was absent from group promotions, to which DR Music replied that Yina was busy with her own individual activities. On June 8, Yina announced in an Instagram post that she was leaving BP RaNia. The agency later confirmed that Yina had decided to focus on her acting career. BP RaNia remained as a six-membered group, releasing their seventh EP Refresh 7th on August 12, with title track \"Beep Beep Beep\". Promotions became controversial when fans noticed that Alex had very few lines, and in fact spent the majority of performances standing off to the side while the other girls danced and sang. On August 19, DR Music announced that Alex had left the group, and that the group would continue promotions as five. Following her departure, Alex took to Twitter and criticized the company in regards to how she was treated and her departure, saying \"People think they can push you around, take advantage of you, manipulate you, violate you then throw you in the trash and walk. Dead wrong.\" On September 13, it was announced that the group would be making a comeback with \"Breathe Heavy\" from their Refresh 7th EP. In January 2018, after fans noticed that Ttabo had missed several appearances with the group, DR Music issued a statement stating she was filming a movie in China. On May 31, DR Music announced the departure of Yumin from the group due to her having \"recently been faced with circumstances that make it increasingly hard for her to follow the extremely demanding team schedule\". It was also announced that the group would be having a comeback in June and releasing a \"Best Of\" album in August, but neither event occurred. On June 28, it was announced that a new member named Namfon had joined the group. She made her first appearance on RaNia's Malaysia tour. On July 17, former member Yumin was announced to be marrying former Topp Dogg member P-Goon. In February 2019, Yumin revealed that following the birth of their son, she and P-Goon had separated, and she was raising the baby herself. On November 7, when asked via SNS by fans if she was still a member Ttabo stated that she is a “former idol”, and following the discovery that every remaining member of the group had removed \"RaNia\" from their social media accounts and that the company had unfollowed some of the members, rumours began to circulate that DR Music as a company had gone bankrupt and was unable to continue operations, resulting in an unofficial disbandment. On August 18, 2019, RaNia announced via their official Instagram account that they would be performing in Romania from September 4–5 with three unconfirmed members. Fans began speculating that this meant Zi.U and Jieun had left the group. On August 28, the group's official YouTube account uploaded a video confirming the Romania performance as well as revealing the three new members as Seunghyun, Larissa, and ex- Stellar member Youngheun, as well as confirming departures of Jieun, Zi.U and Ttabo. On January 25, 2020, Namfon was announced to have left the group, bringing the group's total number of former members to 14. It was also revealed that the group has had no further activities since the performance in Romania. On February 18, Namfon spoke with a fansite and alleged that DR Music did not care about the group, and expressed her hopes that the other members would be able to leave as quickly as possible. In March, Larissa was revealed to have returned to her home country of Brazil, and fans noticed she had \"liked\" a fan comment on RaNia's official instagram that said the company \"should just let the group die in peace\", as well as liking several other comments with the same sentiment.

fadm:Red_Velvet a schema:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Red_Velvet" ;
    dbo:abstract " Red Velvet ( Hangul : 레드벨벳) is a South Korean girl group formed by SM Entertainment . The group debuted on August 1, 2014, with the digital single \" Happiness \" and four group members: Irene , Seulgi , Wendy , and Joy . In March 2015, Yeri was added into the group. Since their debut, Red Velvet has released two studio albums, one reissue album, one compilation album, and nine extended plays in Korean, with eleven of them topping South Korea's Gaon Album Chart . Their singles \"Happiness\", \" Ice Cream Cake \", \" Dumb Dumb \", \" Russian Roulette \", \" Rookie \", \" Peek-a-Boo \", \" Bad Boy \", and \" Psycho \" have all charted in the top five on Gaon Digital Chart , while their singles \" Red Flavor \" and \" Power Up \" topped the chart upon release. Additionally, they made their Japanese debut in July 2018 with the extended play #Cookie Jar . Regarded as one of the most popular K-pop groups worldwide by Time and Billboard , Red Velvet has received several awards for music, choreography, and popularity, including the Golden Disc New Artist Award in 2015 and the Mnet Asian Music Award for Best Female Group in 2017. Seulgi was the first member to be cast as an SM Entertainment trainee through an audition in 2007, while Irene was cast in 2009, and Yeri in 2011. In 2012, Wendy and Joy were cast through the SM Global Auditions in Canada and Seoul respectively. Preparations for Red Velvet began in late 2013, through SM Entertainment's trainee group SM Rookies . Irene and Seulgi were introduced initially to the public through the said project team in 2013, followed by Wendy in 2014. The three members were rumored to debut as a group in July, which was then confirmed by SM Entertainment. With the addition of member Joy, the four-member group would debut as Red Velvet, SM Entertainment's first girl group in five years since f(x) . On August 1, 2014, Red Velvet made their official debut stage on the music program Music Bank . Their debut single, \"Happiness\", was digitally released on August 4. The song was penned by Yoo Young-jin and composed by Will Simms, Chad Hugo ( The Neptunes ), Chris Holsten , and Anne Judith Wik ( Dsign Music ). It was described as an urban Europop song with a strong synth sound and an African tribal beat. The original music video for \"Happiness\" gained more than 2 million views on YouTube in its first 24 hours of release before being removed due to controversy over problematic background images and replaced with an edited version. \"Happiness\" was the second-most viewed K-pop music video worldwide for the month of August in 2014. Red Velvet is also the first K-pop girl group to send their debut single to the Billboard charts , where it peaked at number 4. Red Velvet released their second digital single \"Be Natural\" and its music video on October 13, 2014. The song, which includes a rap verse by NCT member Taeyong, is a remake of the 2000 song of the same name by S.E.S. , SM Entertainment's first girl group. The music video for the song was directed by Kwon Soon-wook and Shim Jae-won, choreographed by Kyle Hanagami, and features original choreography seen in a pre-debut teaser of Irene and Seulgi, which they performed as part of SM Rookies. The group started their promotions on October 9, making their first appearance on the music program, M Countdown . The song peaked at number 33 on the Gaon Digital Chart and at number 6 on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. For their debut, Red Velvet went on to win \"Rookie of The Year\" at the Golden Disk Awards and the Seoul Music Awards . On March 11, 2015, SM Rookies member Yeri was officially announced as part of the group, who received a lot of hate online for a considerably long period of time after her debut. People claimed that the group was better with only 4 members. On March 15, the group's first mini-album Ice Cream Cake was released. The group promoted with double lead singles \" Automatic \" and \" Ice Cream Cake \" for which the music videos were released on March 14 and 15. On March 19, the group held their album showcase on Ice Cream TV , a program streamed through Naver Music and hosted by Shinee 's Minho . On March 27, they won their first music show trophy on KBS 's Music Bank .

In August 2015, Red Velvet held their first U.S. performance during the annual KCON convention and music festival in Los Angeles, California. Red Velvet's first full-length album, The Red , was released on September 9, 2015, with a total of ten tracks including the lead single \" Dumb Dumb \". The album was an immediate success as it was received positively by critics. Billboard 's Jeff Benjamin called The Red \"an impressive, solid debut album\", stating that it \"indicates big things for the act that needs to follow in the footsteps of their beloved female label mates Girls' Generation and f(x) .\" The Red debuted at number 1 on Billboard ' s World Albums Chart and South Korea's Gaon Album Chart , and also appeared in Billboard ' s list of the \"10 Best K-Pop Albums of 2015\", which described the album as \"one of the year's most enjoyable and experimental pop LPs.\" \"Dumb Dumb\" peaked at number three on Billboard World Digital Songs chart, making it the best-selling K-pop song in America of the week. The single also topped the list of the \"Top 20 K-pop Tracks of 2015\" by Dazed , which stated that the group has \"surpassed their idol competitors\" and \"marked a monumental, career-crowning musical tornado\". The music video for \"Dumb Dumb\" was included as the only non-English language entry in Rolling Stone's \"10 Best Music Videos of 2015\". On December 18, the group took part in S.M. Entertainment's special winter project Winter Garden , alongside label-mates f(x) and BoA , releasing a digital single titled \"Wish Tree\". Red Velvet's second mini album The Velvet was intended to be released on March 16, 2016, however, SM Entertainment announced that the music video and album's release would be delayed \"to guarantee a high quality of work\". The album and its title track \" One of These Nights \" (Korean title: 7월 7일) was only released on March 17. The album showcases the smooth R&B-influenced \"velvet\" side of the group's concept and is a direct follow-up album to The Red , which highlighted the group's bright and bold \"red\" persona. The group released their third extended play Russian Roulette on September 7. The album consisted of seven tracks, with the lead single titled \" Russian Roulette \". On September 13, 2016, Red Velvet took their first music show win for Russian Roulette on The Show . The title track also peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and Billboard's World Digital Songs chart, making it their highest rankings on both charts at the time. On February 1, 2017, Red Velvet released their fourth mini album, Rookie . The EP consisted of six tracks; it featured the title track \" Rookie \" and a solo track by Wendy titled \"Last Love\" (마지막 사랑). The album topped the Weekly Gaon Album Chart as well as the Billboard World Albums Chart. The group took their first music show win for \"Rookie\" on The Show on February 7, followed by wins on Show Champion , M Countdown , Music Bank , and Inkigayo . On March 31, the group released the first single for SM Station 2 , titled \"Would U\". For further promotions, from July 27 to September 10, Red Velvet starred in their first reality television program, Level Up Project which showcased the footage of their trip to Thailand. The show aired for 23 episodes, and was shot without member Joy who was filming the drama The Liar and His Lover where she was the female lead. On July 9, Red Velvet released their first summer special extended play The Red Summer with the title track \" Red Flavor \" (빨간 맛). It was their first summer release. The EP was a commercial success, again topping the Gaon Album Chart and the Billboard World Albums Chart. This was their third number 1 release and it set the record for most number 1 albums on the chart by a K-pop girl group. Additionally, \"Red Flavor\" debuted atop the Gaon Digital Chart with the other four songs from the EP also charting in the Top 50. On August 18, the group held their first solo concert titled \"Red Room\" to an audience of 11,000. Although it was initially planned to be a two-day concert, another day was added due to demand. On October 4, SM Entertainment announced through their Japanese website that the group would have their first showcase in Japan . \"Red Velvet Premium Showcase F'U'N Room Reveluv-Baby Party\" took place at the Yebisu The Garden Hall in Tokyo on October 23.

Red Velvet revisited their \"velvet\" image by releasing their second full-length album Perfect Velvet on November 17 with the lead single \" Peek-a-Boo \". Unlike their first \"velvet\" release, the album and single were both commercially successful. The album peaked atop Billboard's World Album Chart. \"Peek-a-Boo\" peaked at number 2 on Billboard's World Digital Songs chart, tying with their 2016 single \"Russian Roulette\". In South Korea, the album and the single \"Peek-a-Boo\" both charted at number 2 on the Gaon Album Chart and Gaon Digital Chart. Through the release of Rookie , The Red Summer and Perfect Velvet all in the same year, along with the popularity of the single \"Red Flavor\" (which according to Jung Ji-won of Osen best represents the year of 2017), and the success of their albums overseas, Red Velvet achieved a \"top girl group\" status in South Korea; their status was further cemented when Perfect Velvet sold over 100,000 copies and \"Peek-A-Boo\" won first place on the music program Inkigayo on their last day of promotions for the song, proving its longevity on the charts. The group released a reissue of Perfect Velvet , The Perfect Red Velvet , on January 29, 2018. It included five new tracks in addition to all the songs from Perfect Velvet , with the single \"Bad Boy\" promoted as its title track. The album topped the Gaon Album Chart upon its release while \"Bad Boy\" debuted at number 2 on the Gaon Digital Chart . The Perfect Red Velvet also charted at number 3 on Billboard's World Albums chart while \"Bad Boy\" debuted at number 2 on its World Digital Songs chart. Red Velvet also entered the Top 10 of Billboard ' s Social 50 chart for the first time, charting at number nine. The album also marked the first time the group has appeared on the Canadian Hot 100 and charted at number 87, becoming only the seventh K-pop artist and the third female act to appear on the chart. Red Velvet promoted the song on various South Korean music shows, earning their first music show win for \"Bad Boy\" on February 8 on Show Champion . In December, Billboard chose \"Bad Boy\" as the best K-pop song of the year. Red Velvet's solo concert \"Red Room\" was held in Tokyo, Japan on March 28 and 29 at the Musashino Forest Sports Plaza , a 10,000-seat capacity venue that will later be used for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics . On the second day, the group announced that they would be officially debuting in Japan in July through a song release. On May 29, 2018, Red Velvet performed alongside other selected South Korean artists for an inter-Korean concert in Pyongyang, North Korea. This makes them the first artist from SM Entertainment in fifteen years since Shinhwa to perform in North Korea. On April 29, 2018, Red Velvet held their first fan meeting at the Rosemont Theater in Chicago, to an audience of 4,000. This event was first solo performance from a female K-pop group in the United States since 2016. The group later toured six Japanese cities in May and June, reaching a total audience of 20,000. Their debut Japanese EP, titled #Cookie Jar , was released on July 4, 2018 by the label Avex Trax , and included six new songs including the Japanese versions of \"Dumb Dumb\", \"Russian Roulette\" and \"Red Flavor\". The other songs were \"#Cookie Jar\" ,\"Aitai-tai\", and \"Cause it's you\". The EP debuted at the third spot of the Oricon Weekly Albums chart and sold 26,124 copies on its first week of release in Japan. On July 19, 2018, Red Velvet announced that they would be making a comeback, and they had filmed their music video outdoors in Gyeonggi-do. The songs from the new album were performed at Red Velvet's second concert \"Redmare\", held in Seoul on August 4–5. On August 6, Red Velvet released their second summer special EP Summer Magic containing eight tracks, including one bonus track and one iTunes exclusive special audio track. Its lead single \" Power Up \" allowed the group to achieve a \" perfect all-kill \" for the first time in their career after it topped all of South Korea's real-time music charts upon its release. The music video for \"Power Up\" went on to be the only K-pop music video to be included in Billboard's list of 50 best music videos of 2018. In September and October, \"Redmare\" was taken to Bangkok, Taipei and Singapore. Red Velvet released their third album in the year and their fifth EP overall on November 30. The EP, titled RBB , includes six tracks with the lead singles being \"RBB (Really Bad Boy)\" and its English version. On January 6, 2019, Red Velvet released their first Japanese digital single, titled \"Sappy\". The group released another Japanese single, \"Sayonara\", on February 20. Both singles are included in their second Japanese EP, Sappy , which was released on May 29; the EP also includes Japanese versions of \"Peek-a-Boo\", \"Rookie\" and \"Power Up\" as well as a new song called \"Swimming Pool\". In February, Red Velvet embarked on the North American leg of their Redmare Tour. They went on to hold shows in Los Angeles , Dallas , Miami , Chicago , and Newark in the United States and Toronto and Vancouver in Canada, becoming the first K-pop girl group to hold a North American tour in three years. On April 5, Red Velvet were featured in a remixed version of \" Close to Me \" by Ellie Goulding and Diplo , with the group contributing Korean lyrics to the song. The song won Choice Electronic/Dance Song at the 2019 Teen Choice Awards . On June 19, Red Velvet released their sixth EP, titled The ReVe Festival: Day 1 , which features the lead single \" Zimzalabim \" and is the first entry of The ReVe Festival trilogy, followed by their seventh EP, The ReVe Festival: Day 2 , with its lead single \" Umpah Umpah \" on August 20. The final release of the trilogy, The ReVe Festival: Finale , was released on December 23, led by the single \" Psycho \". To promote The ReVe Festival trilogy, the group embarked on their third tour, La Rouge, which began in Seoul on November 23 and 24. Red Velvet plays on what they call their \"red\" and \"velvet\" sides, which influences both their image and the music they release. The \"red\" half is their brighter and bubblier side while their \"velvet\" image is their softer, more mature and elegant concept. The 'red' half of the group's music is predominantly of the pop genre while the 'velvet' is primarily R&B and ballads , with the group often mixing it with various genres. Red Velvet's dual image also affects the members' styling . For their \"red\" concept, they are usually dressed in colorful, girlish clothing, such as the pastel sweaters and skirts from \"Ice Cream Cake\" or the red doll outfits from \"Dumb Dumb\". They are dressed more maturely for their \"velvet\" side, most notably, when they wore suits for \"Be Natural\". Red Velvet has been lauded for breaking stereotypes among popular girl groups in South Korea whose concepts tend to fall under two categories which are \"cute or pure\" and \"sexy\", often to fulfill a certain fantasy. In a country where girl groups' fanbases are typically mostly male, according to Taylor Glasby of Dazed Digital , the majority of Red Velvet's fans are young women. IZE Magazine named the group as one of the successful female figures who helped transform the \"passive image\" of South Korean women. Billboard reported in December 2018 that Red Velvet was the overall favorite k-pop group of the year among every gender and sexual identity on the popular internet forum Reddit . In February 2018, Time magazine named Red Velvet as one of the best K-pop groups, highlighting their versatile musical styles. Red Velvet was also recognized for their brand recognition and marketing power, having topped the 'Girl Group Brand Power Ranking' published by the Korean Corporate Reputation Research Institute for three consecutive months. In November 2019, Billboard has crowned Red Velvet as \"the best idol group alive\" and has named \" Red Flavor \" as the second-best K-pop song of the 2010s. Red Velvet performed in Pyongyang on April 1, 2018. This made them the seventh idol group to ever perform in North Korea. They performed \" Red Flavor \" and \"Bad Boy\" at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre to an audience including Kim Jong-un . The concert was billed as \"Spring is Coming\" and is part of a wider diplomatic initiative between South Korea and North Korea. In October of the same year, South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism awarded the group the 'Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism's Commendation' for their contributions in raising awareness of the country's popular culture and arts. The director of the Korea Foundation for International Cultural Exchange while discussing the Korean Wave in 2018 cited Red Velvet as a major contributor and one of the country's most talented idol groups who have \"largely promoted K-pop\".

    dbo:abstract " Shinee ( / ˈ ʃ aɪ n iː / SHY -nee ; Korean : 샤이니 , romanized : Syaini ; Japanese : シャイニー , romanized : Shainī ; stylized as SHINee ) is a South Korean boy band formed by SM Entertainment in 2008. The group's musical impact in their native country has earned them numerous accolades and the title \"Princes of K-pop\". The group is composed of four members: Onew , Key , Minho , and Taemin . Originally a five-piece group, vocalist Jonghyun died in December 2017. Shinee was introduced as a contemporary R&B boy group by their company with the goal of being trendsetters in all areas of music, fashion, dance, etc. and debuted in May 2008 with their first EP , Replay , on SBS ' Inkigayo with their single \"Replay\". The group gained attention for starting a fashion trend amongst students, which the media dubbed the \"Shinee Trend\". In August 2008, the group released their first Korean studio album, The Shinee World , which won the Newcomer Album of the Year at the 23rd Golden Disc Awards . Shinee further consolidated their popularity on the South Korean music scene with follow-up singles \" Ring Ding Dong \" and \" Lucifer \". \"Ring Ding Dong\" charted on top of several Korean music charts and gained popularity all over Asia. \"Lucifer\" was nominated for the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards in 2010 for its outstanding choreography. In 2012 the group released Sherlock , which became the fifth most sold album of the year with over 180,000 copies sold. The group has also been included in the Forbes list of Korea Power Celebrity multiple times, once in 2014 and again in 2016. In mid-2011, Shinee signed with EMI Records Japan to venture into the Japanese music scene. Their Japanese version of their single \" Replay \" sold over 100,000 copies, the highest number of sales for a Japanese debut single recorded by Oricon for a South Korean group at the time. It was followed by their first Japanese studio album, The First , on December 7, 2011 – both were certified Gold by RIAJ for selling over 100,000 copies. In 2011, the group also held their Japan Debut Premium Reception at Abbey Road Studios in London, making them the first Asian artists to perform there. Two years later they released their second Japanese album Boys Meet U (2013), followed by I'm Your Boy (2014), D×D×D (2016), and Five (2017). Shinee is considered to be one of the best live vocal groups in K-pop and is known for their highly synchronized and complex dance routines, having been awarded the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards three times in a row for their dance performances to \" Sherlock \", \" Dream Girl \" and \" View \". Shinee's signature musical style is contemporary R&B, but the group is known for their experimental sound, incorporating various genres including funk rock , hip hop , and EDM . Prior to the group's debut, the label company, SM Entertainment , introduced an upcoming contemporary R&B boy group with its goal to be trendsetters in all areas of music, fashion and dance. The group's Korean name, Shinee, is a new coined word and is explained as a combination of shine , meaning light, and the suffix ee , therefore meaning \"one who receives the light\". On May 22, 2008, the group's first EP, Replay , was released, which debuted at number ten on the Korean music charts and peaked at number eight, selling 17,957 copies in the first half of 2008. On May 25, 2008, Shinee had their first stage performance on SBS 's Inkigayo with their single \" Replay \". In June 2008, the group won their first award, \"Rookie of the Month\", at the Cyworld Digital Music Awards , and were also awarded with the \"Hot New Star\" award at the Mnet 20's Choice Awards in August 2008. In the same month, Shinee subsequently released their first full-length album, The SHINee World , which debuted at number three, selling 30,000 copies. Its title track \" Sanso Gateun Neo (Love Like Oxygen) \" is a cover of \"Show the World\" by Martin Hoberg Hedegaard , originally written by the Danish songwriting and production team of Thomas Troelsen , Remee , and Lucas Secon . On September 18, 2008, the song won first place on M! Countdown making it the group's first win on Korean music shows since debut. Shinee participated in the 5th Asia Song Festival , where they received the \"Best New Artist\" award along with Japanese girl group Berryz Kobo . The group attended the Style Icon Awards on October 30, 2008, where they received the \"Best Style Icon Award\". On the same day, a repackaged version of The Shinee World , titled A.Mi.Go , was released, which includes three new songs: \"Forever or Never\", a remix of \"Love Should Go On\", and the title track \"Amigo\". \"A.Mi.Go\" is a shortened version of the Korean phrase \"Areumdaun Minyeoreul Joahamyeon Gosaenghanda\", which can be translated to \"The heart aches when you fall in love with a beauty\". In November 2008, Shinee won the \"Best New Male Group\" award at the 10th annual Mnet Asian Music Awards , beating fellow newcomers U-KISS , 2PM , 2AM and Mighty Mouth . In addition, the group also won the award for \"Newcomer Album of the Year\" at the 23rd Annual Golden Disk Awards . In early February 2009, Shinee won the \"Best Newcomer\" award along with Davichi and Mighty Mouth at the 18th Seoul Music Awards . Shinee's second extended play, Romeo , was released on May 25. Its lead single, \" Juliette \", was released earlier on May 18. The song is an instrumental remake of Corbin Bleu 's \" Deal with It \". Shinee had their first stage performance for the song on KBS 's Music Bank in June 2009, where the group also received the award for the first place. Shinee released the digital version of their third extended play, 2009, Year of Us , on October 19, 2009, with a physical release on October 22. The lead single, \" Ring Ding Dong \", was released digitally on October 14 and charted atop of several Korean music charts and gained popularity all over Asia. In early December 2009, the group was also awarded with the \"Popularity\" award along with Super Junior at the 24th Golden Disk Awards . On July 19, 2010, the group released their second full-length studio album, Lucifer , which topped various physical and digital sales charts in South Korea. The songs on the album \"were more carefully selected than ever\", and the album is said to \"[give] listeners a great chance to experience the diverse musical characters and more mature vocal skills of the members.\" The group made their comeback on July 23, 2010, at KBS Music Bank . For its outstanding choreography, \"Lucifer\" was nominated for the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . Lucifer became the 6th best-selling album of 2010 in South Korea, selling over 120,000 copies. In October 2010, the album was re-released under the title Hello . Amidst their promotional activities for the second studio album, the group also participated in the SMTown Live '10 World Tour on August 21, 2010.

Shinee is known for their fashion style, initially created by designer Ha Sang-beg ( 하상백 ), which features high-top sneakers, skinny jeans, and colorful sweaters. Their style has created a fashion trend amongst students which the media dubbed the \"Shinee Trend\". The group's \"boyish charm\" was an important factor in Shinee gaining fans. With the release of 2009, Year of Us , Shinee's style became more mature, though still maintaining Shinee's unique image. Furthermore, instead of working with famous artists and photographers, SM Entertainment's Visual and Art Directing department usually works with up-and-coming talents with new ideas for Shinee's concepts. When Shinee debuted in 2008 with \"Replay\", it was not only their music which gained attention but also their colorful style—but even four years later, in 2012, Shinee maintained their colorful concept for Sherlock . Their designer, Ha Sang-beg, stated in an interview with the Korean Times: \"Much has evolved over the years, since I change their styles to reflect their music. The feel from their debut single still exists, mixing the overground [ sic ] with the underground, haute couture with street fashion ... but it is very modern, like Shinee.\" Shinee are acknowledged for their innovative approach to music and peerless choreography and are considered as one of the best live vocalists and dancers in Korean pop , known for their good vocal performances and complex choreographies as well as a unique kind of music that is quite different from usual K-pop. At SM Entertainment 's showcase in New York in October 2011, Jon Caramanica of the New York Times summarized them as \"the most ambitious\" of the evening and also complimented the group's strong vocal performance. Furthermore, he stated: \"Their music, especially Replay , Ring Ding Dong and Juliette , felt the riskiest, even if it only slightly tweaked that polyglot Pop formula\". Kim Joo-hyun of Beff Report considers Shinee's greatest strength the dismantling of the boundaries between the role of main vocal and subvocal. He positively emphasised the harmony between the two main vocals, Onew and Jonghyun, saying they sing with an aesthetic of \"contrast\", meaning they can't be separated from each other; on the contrary, they actually suit each other when brought together. He also praised the vocal development of Taemin, the youngest member in the group. Jakob Dorof of the monthly British style magazine Dazed described Shinee with the words \"technicolor visuals\", \"choreography as coordinated as ballet\", and \"wildly adventurous hit songs\", stating they are a group that embodies the harmony of these qualities better than anyone else. Tamar Herman of Paste Magazine described Shinee as one of K-pop's most popular dance groups, \"with cutting edge dance moves that are just as technically creative as the songs they've performed\". Shinee have worked with top choreographers such as Rino Nakasone , who choreographed Shinee's early songs like \"Replay\" and \"Love Like Oxygen\" in 2008, \"Juliette\" in 2009, and the group's hit single \"Lucifer\" in 2010, which was nominated for the Best Dance Performance at the Mnet Asian Music Awards in 2010. Misha Gabriel choreographed the songs \"Amigo\" (2008) and \"Ring Ding Dong\" (2009). Tony Testa worked on Shinee's later hit songs like \"Sherlock\" (2012) and \"Dream Girl\" (2013), which are characterized by a unique and distinctive style, while Ian Eastwood worked on \"View\" (2015) – breaking away from the group's usual powerful and precise choreography and working instead with a groove style that showcases the teamwork of the group. All three songs were awarded with the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards : in 2012, 2013, and 2015. The predominant musical genre of the group is contemporary R&B . The group's early hits like \"Replay\" and \"Lucifer\" veered toward R&B and dance pop, while singles such as \"Get Down\" and \"Jo Jo\" explored other musical styles such as hip-hop and dance. Shinee's third album is significantly influenced by funk rock , electronic music and rock. Billboard columnist Jeff Benjamin compared Shinee's songs like \"Punch Drunk Love\" and \"Aside\" to the sounds of Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie , while tracks like \"Beautiful\" and \"Runaway\" combine \"unique electronic production elements over sugary boy band harmonies to create year-round pop music\". Shinee as a group is known for their experimental sound and various genres with every new release like the group's fifth extended play, Everybody , whose title song is classified under the complextro genre. Jakob Dorof of Tiny Mix Tapes stated that \" Everybody is proof positive that, even in a culture industry designed to minimize the role of real musicianship, talent will find its way to the top.\" He also remarked that \" Close the Door \" highlights the experimental and versatile nature of Shinee's music which frequently charts into unfamiliar territories. With the release of their fourth Korean album, Odd , Shinee returned to their old sound while experimenting with new genres like deep house . The album featured songs in an array of styles including the two singles the electro-house \"View\" and Rocky Horror-inspired funk track \"Married to the Music.\" Alexis Hodoyan-Gastelum of MTV IGGY praised the title song, \"View\", describing it as a great, laid back summer jam even though \"the song fools us into thinking it's an uptempo ballad before reaching its techno peak at the chorus.\" Jeff Benjamin on the other hand praised \"Odd Eye\", which is written and composed by member Jonghyun. Benjamin states the group's \"return to the R&B side of Shinee with feathery vocals, tight harmonies and member Onew's falsetto howls acting a centerpiece to this grooving opener\" but he also adds, \"despite initially debuting with a R&B sound, Shinee is arguably most exciting when experimenting\". Early in their career, Shinee were endorsers for several brands, such as the cosmetic brand Nana's B and the sports brand Reebok . Later, they endorsed the clothing brand Maypole as well as the popular Korean cosmetic brands Etude House and The Saem. In 2012, Etude House's Lash Pump 3-Step Volume-Cara, a PC-based and mobile micro-site featuring \"doll eyelashes\" main model Sandara Park and Shinee—appearing as puppets—was awarded first place for the Movile Marketing and Product Promotions category at the 9th Web Award Korea . The group was also part of the popular Korean comic The Blade of the Phantom Master and then-new webtoon series ENT . Furthermore, the group endorsed the sports brand Skechers and collaborated with Naver and Skechers for T-shirts and caps designed by the group members. Overall, Shinee are models with influence over consumers, as products featuring the Shinee label can increase the revenue of companies – \"Shinee's Sparking Water\", a simple carbonated bottled water, which is sold by e-mart , the supermarket chain business of Shinsegae , boasted a combined sales of 67 million won over a one-month period.

    dbo:abstract """Super Junior-T ( Korean : 슈퍼주니어-트 ), an initialism for Super Junior-Trot is the second official sub-group of South Korean boy band Super Junior . They are the first idol group known for capitalizing trot music , the oldest form of Korean pop music . Formed in 2007, the group consists of five Super Junior members Leeteuk , Heechul , Shindong , Sungmin , and Eunhyuk . Super Junior-T released their debut CD single on 23 February 2007 the short span of their career before they were announced to be on hiatus in 2008. The single " Rokuko " was Korea's sixteenth best-selling record and the number one best-selling single of 2007, according to the Music Industry Association of Korea. In November 2008, the subgroup made their debut in Japan with released the Japanese version of "Rokuko". Noticing the dying trend of trot music, Lee Soo Man decided to revive the style by producing an idol band that capitalizes this genre. Three months before Super Junior-T's official debut, they performed "Don't Go Away" at the M.NET/KM Music Festival on November 25, 2006 with Super Junior's Donghae . In early February, SM Entertainment made the official announcement of a second Super Junior subgroup, Super Junior-T. The group released their debut single " Rokuko " on February 23, 2007 and on February 25, 2007, they officially debuted on SBS's Popular Songs , performing "Rokuko" and "First Express" with famous trot singer Bang Shilyi. The debut was also marked as Heechul's comeback performance after his injury from a car accident that occurred in August 2006. "Rokuko" topped music charts three days after release. Two months later, the single topped Thailand-based music stations and remained in the same position for several weeks. By the end of 2007, the single sold almost 46,000 copies and was Korea's best-selling single of the year. Two months later, Leeteuk, Shindong, and Eunhyuk were injured in a car accident , and all of Super Junior-T's schedules were completely canceled for two months. However, pre-recorded performances, such as the group's parody Palace T , continued to air on television and their single continued to top music charts. Schedules resumed in June, but only lasted a month. On April 29, 2008, it was announced that Super Junior-T would make a comeback later in the year with their second single. However, a fourth Super Junior sub-unit, Super Junior-Happy , debuted instead, putting Super Junior-T in partial hiatus. Nonetheless, Super Junior-T remained partially active throughout the year as they still appear as a group in Super Junior's concert tour, Super Show and other similar functions. Despite the debut of Super Junior-Happy, a future full-length album is still in the works and is expected to arrive in the future. Super Junior-T's latest appearance before the debut of Super Junior-Happy was on May 17, 2008, performing as the opening act at the 6th Korean Music Festival in Los Angeles , California . On November 5, 2008, Super Junior-T re-released "Rokuko", now titled " ROCK&GO ", in Japan. Presenting this project to the Japanese comedy duo Moeyan, who are skilled in combining comedy with song and dance, Super Junior-T hopes that the duo will help them localize the single into Japanese. The collaboration was the duo's official debut as singers and Super Junior-T's entrance in the Japanese market. The single debuted at #19 on the Oricon Daily Charts and jumped to #2 three days later. Super Junior-T and Moeyan held two mini concerts on the same release date as the single in the C.C. Lemon Hall at Tokyo to promote the record. In 2015, Super Junior returned with special album Devil on July 16 to celebrate the group's 10th anniversary. The album has a total of 10 tracks including the Track "Love at First Sight". The track is partly classified by Super Junior-T and Kang Junwoo writing lyrics and composing for it. The group made their comeback performance on the Korean music show M! Countdown with the song "Love at First Sight" on July 16, 2015. Super Junior-T is well known for their parodies, such as the short miniseries Palace T , a parody of the popular Korean drama , Princess Hours which aired on the channel M.NET, as a part of Idol World . Due to Super Junior-T's active participance in trot music and their comedic appearances, the group gained outstanding attention from the older audience despite their well-known young idol images that was created for them in the main group Super Junior. Members of Super Junior-T explained that they wanted to change their idol appearance and hope that they would gain different fans from their new trot image.

    dbo:abstract "Stellar ( Hangul : 스텔라) was a South Korean girl group whose final lineup was composed of Minhee, Hyoeun, Soyoung and Youngheun and that disbanded in 2018. Formed in 2011 by The Entertainment Pascal, [fn 1] the group attracted attention as they were initially produced by Eric Mun of the boy band Shinhwa . Following an unsuccessful debut with the single \"Rocket Girl\" in August 2011, Stellar underwent a line-up change and released \"UFO\" in February 2012, which fared similarly. [ better source needed ] The group began working with production team MonoTree in July 2013 and released \"Study\", which experienced modest success and became their first single to chart in the top 100 of the Gaon Digital Chart . [fn 2] Stellar gained notoriety in February 2014, when they adopted a more \"provocative\" image for the release of their first extended play Marionette . The album's title track peaked at number thirty-five on the Gaon Digital Chart, making it their most commercially successful single. This stylistic change in direction would be maintained in Stellar's subsequent releases \"Vibrato\" in 2015 and their second extended play Sting in 2016. The formation of Stellar began as early as 2010, originally supposed to be a six-membered group with a former trainee from Japan, but Top Class Entertainment reported that member Kim Gayoung had signed an exclusive contract with the company and would be joining a five-member girl group. Gayoung had gained attention for her appearance on the Viewers' Tour episode of 1 Night 2 Days and had been cast in the drama series Poseidon alongside Top Class Entertainment operator and Shinhwa member Eric Mun. The series was set to air on the SBS network until production halted following the November 2010 Yeonpyeong bombardment incident. The roles were subsequently recast when production was greenlit by KBS a year later. Gayoung was later cast in the 2011 drama Spy Myung-wol along with Mun. The final debut line-up of Stellar was Gayoung, true rookie Jeon-yul, and ex-Honeydew members Lee-seul and JoA. The group officially debuted on August 28, 2011, with the release of the digital single \"Rocket Girl\". On January 26, 2012, it was announced that Lee-seul and JoA were leaving the group and would be replaced by Min-hee and Hyo-eun for their first comeback track \"UFO\". On July 11, 2013, Stellar released their third digital single \"Study\" which, and chart in the top 100 their first time. On February 12, 2014, Stellar released their first extended play Marionette . The group received criticism for their \"stripping game\" promotional material, which involved fans having to \"like\" posts on Stellar's official Facebook page to reveal photos of the members' body parts. The group received further criticism for their 19+ music video and performances of \" Marionette \". Despite the controversy, \"Marionette\" became their best selling single, peaking at number 35 and 34 on Gaon and Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 charts, respectively. On August 21, 2014, Stellar released the digital single \"Mask\". On March 9, 2015, Stellar released the digital single \"Fool\" and its music video. The MV shows the members reacting to the negative comments of their past comebacks. On July 20, 2015, Stellar released the single \"Vibrato\" and another controversial music video, gaining more recognition. The group responded to criticism of their revealing performance outfits with the explanation that \"Vibrato\"'s sexy music video was merely meant to be an expression of the group's unique identity. While promoting \"Vibrato\", Stellar released a virtual reality clip of a July 27 performance. The video – created by virtual reality company Moovr – allows viewers to use their computer mouse or move their smartphone to scroll around a 360-degree rotating view of the stage as the four members perform. On January 8, 2016, it was announced that the group would return on January 18 with their second mini-album titled Sting . The album's creation was supported in part through a Makestar-hosted crowd-funding campaign. The campaign's original goal of $8,418 was reached in only three days, ultimately reaching 422% of its goal with $35,510. On January 18, 2016, the album and a music video for the title track \" Sting \" were released. The band explained that their intentions for \"Sting\" were different from \"Marionette\" and \"Vibrato\", stating \"This time, we wanted to look more like a girlfriend rather than to [...] look provocative. We put on lighter makeup so that more fans will feel closer to us.\" The previously released single \"Vibrato\" was included as the final track on the album. Stellar announced on April 1 that they would be holding their first solo concert, since their debut, on April 22, 2016, at Seoul's Yes24 MUVHALL. They brought to their fans a range of unique performances, including hit songs like \"Marionette\" and \"Sting\". The concert was live-streamed on various websites such as Allreh TV, Allreh TV mobile and Goliveconcert.com. [ better source needed ] On July 10, 2016, it was officially announced that the group would be releasing their seventh single album called \" Cry \" on July 18, posting the date of release and the first teaser images for the single through their official Twitter account. This project was also supported, in part, by a Makestar crowd-funding project which raised $53,593 (532% of its original goal). They went on to hold a second concert, entitled 'Stellar 2nd Concert: After Story' on December 3, 2016, while also debuting in Japan with a showcase in Tokyo on August 27 and a concert on December 24. Stellar ended 2016 by launching a third Makestar fundraising event in support of their third mini-album on December 26. By the time the project finished they had reached 1,132% of their original goal, making them the first group on Makestar to achieve over 1,000%. On March 25, 2017, Stellar held a special fansign in the city of Fortaleza , Brazil. On March 26, 2017, Stellar was the first Korean girl group to hold a solo concert in Brazil, playing for a sold-out crowd of almost 1,000 people. On May 17, it was reported that their new mini-album was to be released in late June. It was also revealed that a new member could possibly join the line-up with their new release. On May 18, The Entertainment Pascal confirmed the addition of a new member, So-young, via Stellar's Makestar Project. On June 20, The Entertainment Pascal announced that the group's third mini-album was set to be released on June 27 and was titled Stellar Into the World , with the title track \"Archangels of the Sephiroth\". The teasers for the release showed an Angel vs. Witch theme, represented by mirroring photos where one had a light theme and the other had a dark theme. This theme was confirmed by both the tags used for the teaser images on social media and in a radio interview starring Stellar. On August 22, it was announced that the group would be holding a special anniversary concert titled \"Interstellar: Time Travel Through 6 Years\" on August 28. On August 23, it was confirmed that Gayoung and Jeonyul would leave Stellar at the end of the month after they decided not to renew their contracts with The Entertainment Pascal. On August 25, Stellar announced the addition of a new member, Youngheun. On September 30, members Youngheun and Soyoung were seen in YG Entertainment 's teaser for Mix Nine , a show that would create a temporary boy or girl group, but neither member made it past the auditions. On February 22, 2018, the members posted to social media about how they had arranged a \"final\" fan meeting for the group, to be held on February 25, 2018. Also on February 22, Gayoung tweeted \"People who play with other people's emotions are the worst!\", to which Hyoeun replied \"True\". Many fans took this to mean that the members were expressing their dissatisfaction with the company. On February 26, it was revealed that Minhee and Hyoeun had chosen not to renew their contracts with the company, and, as a result, the group would be disbanding. Shortly after the disbandment, Minhee gave an interview where she apologized to the group's fans and assured them there was no discord among the members. She stated that Jeonyul and Gayoung were looking to move into acting, but she and Hyoeun had not decided what they were going to do yet. On October 30, 2018 Minhee released a video of Stellar's first reunion party after disbandment through her YouTube channel \"About Mini\". Gayoung, Minhee, Hyoeun and Jeonyul attended the event. Minhee explained that the Reunion Party was created thanks to fans. On October 29, 2018 An SBS Special Documentary was released about the life of idols. A segment on Gayoung and Stellar revealed the difficulties members faced while being a part of Stellar, as well as showing some of the story after the disbandment of the group. The segment focused on Gayoung and her pursuit of being an actress, while running a cafe. In an interview with Insight on December 17, 2018, Gayoung revealed the difficulties that she and her members faced from performing the sexy concept, from both the perception of the public, as well as the pressure that their company placed on members to do what the company wanted, whenever the members said that they didn't want to do a particular thing (such as a particular concept). When asked if she would be an idol again, Gayoung responded that \"I don't think I would do it again\". She concluded the interview with advice to new aspiring idols, that while it is important to work hard, the direction in which you are pursuing is important too. After the Insight interview there was an immense response in the comments left for members both on the Insight interview video, as well as the Stellar reunion party video. In a response to the comments left on Stellar's first reunion party video, Minhee released a Q&A video on January 13, 2019. In response to a question about how much members earned from their work during Stellar, it was revealed that each member earned less than 10,000,000 Won (~$9,000 USD) over the 7 years they worked under their company. On August 28, 2019 it was revealed that Youngheun has become a member of Rania . " ;

fadm:SuperM a schema:Class ;
    rdfs:label "SuperM" ;
    dbo:abstract """SuperM ( Hangul : 슈퍼엠) is a South Korean pop group formed in 2019 by SM Entertainment and Capitol Music Group . The group includes seven members from four SM boy groups: Taemin from Shinee , Baekhyun and Kai from Exo , Taeyong and Mark from NCT and Ten and Lucas from WayV . On October 4, 2019, the group debuted with their self-titled EP . All members of SuperM were assembled from existing boy groups under SM Entertainment . Taemin debuted as a member of Shinee in May 2008. Baekhyun and Kai debuted as members of Exo in April 2012. Taeyong , Ten , and Mark debuted as members of NCT in April 2016. Lucas debuted in January 2018 as a new member of NCT. Taeyong and Mark were later added to NCT's South Korea-based sub-unit, NCT 127 , in July 2016, while Ten and Lucas were added to NCT's China-based sub-unit, WayV , in January 2019. In 2019, before the official announcement of SuperM's debut, there had been rumors that SM Entertainment was planning to debut a " K-pop Super Boy Band". On August 7, 2019, Capitol Music Group chairman Steve Barnett and SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man officially announced the group as SuperM at Capitol Congress 2019. The "M" in SuperM stands for both Matrix and Master, with each member already an established star in their own bands. The teaser revealed the members of the group, with each having performance, vocal, and rap abilities. Lee described the group as "the Avengers of K-pop," with the group focusing more on performance-based music. SM A&R executive and director Chris Lee stated that the group was in the works for around a year, and felt the analogy to the Avengers was apt because according to him, "Each Avenger has their own group and Iron Man has his own movie and Thor has his own, but together, they have an even greater synergy, so like that the members will pursue their own careers and own groups but also join together with synergy - a positive one." Audiences and followers had mixed opinions on the project at first, with some fans enthusiastic for the band's debut following the release of the first teaser at Capitol Congress 2019, while others were concerned about SM Entertainment prioritizing their established groups, Exo members establishing solo careers before their mandatory military service , and the group debuting in the United States rather than starting with Korean promotions. Writing for MTV News , Caitlin Kelley opines that "the biggest takeaway from the backlash is that it's not that easy to combine the powers of multiple fandoms," and felt that the group's structure might be complicated for American audiences, although she noted that "the fact that SuperM trended worldwide for several hours shows potential. That level of engagement means that there is widespread interest in the group — now it's just a matter of turning public opinion around." Kate Halliwell of The Ringer wrote, "plenty of people support several groups within the K-pop genre at large, and it makes sense to target them whenever possible...but the toxic side of fandom is difficult to escape." She adds that the formation of the group "once again [proves] how online backlash is inevitable, and often overwhelming, when it comes to navigating multiple K-pop fandoms at once," although she felt that the formation of the group "[signifies] a rising tide in Western K-pop demand." SuperM promoted their debut album both in the United States and in South Korea. Several teasers for the group were posted in SuperM's various social media channels. The group filmed their debut music video in Dubai in August 2019. The group's self-titled debut EP was released on October 4, with the instrumental of one of the album's songs, "I Can't Stand the Rain", released on August 28. SuperM' s lead single, "Jopping", was released alongside its music video on the same day as the EP. The EP debuted at number one at the Billboard 200 albums chart, with 168,000 equivalent album units in the week ending October 10. SuperM had their debut concert at the Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles on October 5, and made their television debut on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on October 9. The group is currently embarking on their first tour, We Are the Future Live, with ten dates in North America from November 2019 to February 2020. The tour was extended to Latin America and Europe, with three tour dates in February 2020. SuperM were announced as global ambassadors for Korean Air in November 2019. On November 4, the group was featured alongside SM labelmate BoA in Korean Air's safety video, which was added to all Korean Air flights on the same day. The song featured in the video, "Let's Go Everywhere," was released on November 18, and proceeds of the song will be donated to Global Poverty Project 's Global Citizen campaign. SuperM: We Are the Future Live is SuperM's first world tour to promote their eponymous debut album. The tour was officially announced on October 2, 2019 with tickets going on sale on October 5, 2019. The tour began on November 11, 2019 in Fort Worth and initially visited 9 cities in North America. Its world tour extension began on February 9, 2020 in Latin America, Europe and Asia.

    dbo:abstract """ T-ara ( / t i ˈ ɑː r ə / ; Korean : 티아라 ) is a South Korean girl group , formed in 2009 by MBK Entertainment . T-ara's career is marked by hook-heavy dance-pop music, a result of their close partnership with composer Shinsadong Tiger . A broad array of visual concepts have earned the group a "chameleon-like" reputation. [b] The group officially debuted in July 2009 with the single "Lie", following line-up changes due to creative differences. Their debut studio album Absolute First Album was released in December 2009 and spawned several hit songs including " TTL (Time to Love) ", " Bo Peep Bo Peep ", and "You Drive Me Crazy". T-ara gained nationwide recognition after releasing " Roly-Poly " in 2011, which went on to become the Gaon chart's best-selling single of the year. At the height of K-pop's popularity in Japan, T-ara signed onto management agency J-Rock for $4.7 million—reportedly the highest figure of any Korean girl group expanding into the territory at the time. Both their debut Japanese single and studio album reached number one on the Oricon weekly charts and were subsequently certified Gold. T-ara's late-2011 Korean release Black Eyes spawned three consecutive number ones: "Cry Cry", "We Were in Love" and " Lovey-Dovey ". In 2012, T-ara experienced a dip in popularity as the group faced accusations of internal discord, resulting in Hwayoung 's immediate departure with Areum following a year after. T-ara's later material was released to varying degrees of success before the group began focusing on promotional activities in China, where they attracted attention for their cover of Chopstick Brothers' " Little Apple " in 2014. T-ara is regarded as one of the most popular K-pop girl groups in China. T-ara's final release as six members was tentatively scheduled for May 2017, ahead of Soyeon and Boram 's expiring contracts; however, conflicts with their management delayed What's My name? until June 2017, effectively without their involvement. Qri , Eunjung , Hyomin and Jiyeon had previously extended their terms with MBK Entertainment until December 31, 2017. The original pre-debut five T-ara members (Jiae, Jiwon, Eunjung , Hyomin and Jiyeon ) trained together for three years under Mnet Media . The meaning behind the group's name, which is based on the word " tiara ", comes from the idea that they will become the "queens of the music industry". In April 2009, they released their first song "Joheun Saram (Ver. 1)" (좋은 사람, "Good Person") for the Cinderella Man soundtrack. Jiyeon teamed up with labelmates SeeYa and Davichi for a collaboration single titled "Yeoseong Shidae" (여성시대, "Women's Generation"), which was released in May 2009. In June 2009, Mnet Media announced that Jiae and Jiwon would be leaving T-ara due to differences in music style. The first new member to be added to the group was Boram , the daughter of singer Jeon Young-rok and actress Lee Mi-young. Soyeon , a former trainee of SM Entertainment who was supposed to be the leader of Girls' Generation , and Qri were added to T-ara three weeks prior to debut. In early July 2009, the group was moved from Mnet Media to its subsidiary company Core Contents Media. T-ara made their debut on MBC 's Radio Star talk show on July 29, 2009. Their first performance was on Mnet 's M Countdown music show on July 30, where they performed " Geojitmal " (거짓말, "Lies") and "Norabollae?" (놀아볼래?, "Wanna Play?") from their debut single. Their debut was looked upon negatively by webpostings, where people stated that it was lipsynched and commented that it seemed like an "elementary school" performance. The group announced afterwards that future performances would be live. In September 2009, Eunjung, Soyeon, Hyomin and Jiyeon collaborated with labelmates Kwangsu, Jihyuk, and Geonil of Supernova for the single " TTL (Time to Love) ". It was released on September 15, 2009, and became both groups' first number one song as it topped many of the online charts. T-ara and Supernova collaborated again for " TTL Listen 2 ", a sequel to "TTL (Time to Love)", which was released on October 9, 2009, and included all the members from both groups. T-ara released their debut studio album, Absolute First Album , on November 27, 2009. In order to determine the album's title track, Core Contents Media held a survey in which the public had to choose between " Bo Peep Bo Peep " or "Cheoeum Cheoreom" (처음처럼, "Like the First Time"). 9,000 people took the survey on various music portals with 53% (4,770 people) choosing "Cheoeum Cheoreom" over "Bo Peep Bo Peep". However, the latter was promoted on music shows instead for unknown reasons. "Bo Peep Bo Peep" peaked at number four on the Gaon chart, while "Cheoeum Cheoreom" peaked at number ten. They held their comeback performance on Music Bank on December 4, 2009. At the 24th Golden Disk Awards , T-ara was awarded Rookie of the Year along with girl group 4minute . The group won their first-ever music show award with "Bo Peep Bo Peep" on the New Year's Day episode of Music Bank . The song went on to win five awards in total: two on Music Bank and three on Inkigayo , earning them a "Triple Crown". Later in January 2010, the group announced promotions for their follow up single, "Cheoeum Cheoreom", which ended quickly as Soyeon was diagnosed with H1N1 . The same month, T-ara made a cameo appearance on the seventh and eight episodes of God of Study , in which Jiyeon played a main role. In February 2010, the group announced a re-release of their debut album under the title Breaking Heart . The two lead singles, "Neo Ttaemune Michyeo" (너 때문에 미쳐; "I Go Crazy Because of You") and "Naega Neomu Apa" (내가 너무 아파, "I'm Really Hurt"), were digitally released on February 23, 2010, and peaked at number one and number thirty-one on the Gaon chart, respectively.
T-ara held their comeback performance on the same day on M Countdown , and won several music awards for "Neo Ttaemune Michyeo" over the course of their promotions: two consecutive Mutizen wins on Inkigayo and one first place award on M Countdown . Breaking Heart was released physically on March 3, 2010, peaking at number two on the weekly Gaon chart and number thirty-five on the yearly chart; selling 40,695 copies. After promotions for "Neo Ttaemune Michyeo" ended, T-ara performed "Naega Neomu Apa" on music shows until early April 2010. In June 2010, the group donated all the proceeds of the World Cup merchandise sold on their online clothing shop T-ara Dot Com to a charity for African children. On July 16, 2010 T-ARA representatives announced the addition of Hwayoung Ryu as the seventh member of the group. The reason given was that with so many solo projects, they would be able to have a more complete lineup for T-ARA when individual members were filming or doing other appearances. They also stated that it would allow the members to undertake more solo activities, and would give them all some relief from their heavy schedules. In November 2010, the group was in the third season of the reality show Hello Baby , in which they took care of Moon Mason and his two brothers. T-ara released the digital download for " Wae Ireoni " (왜 이러니, "Why Are You Being Like This"), the lead single for their first extended play, Temptastic , on November 23, 2010. Temptastic was released in digital format on December 1, 2010, along with their second single, " Yayaya ". The album's physical release was delayed until December 3 due to the bombardment of Yeonpyeong earlier in November 2010. T-ara held their first comeback performance through Music Bank on December 3 and began promotions with their new seventh member, Hwayoung , and new leader, Boram, and received two consecutive wins for "Wae Ireoni" and "Yayaya" on M Countdown . T-ara's second EP John Travolta Wannabe was released on June 29, 2011. It charted at number three on the Gaon Album Chart and has sold 30,116 copies as of 2011. The EP's only single, " Roly-Poly ", peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and number one on the Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart. The single became a breakthrough success, becoming the top-grossing and highest-selling single of 2011 in South Korea with over four digital million units sold. "Roly-Poly" was awarded Best Music Video at the 3rd Melon Music Awards and Singer of the Year (July) at the 1st Gaon Chart Awards , and was nominated Best Dance Performance by a Female Group and Song of the Year at the 13th Mnet Asian Music Awards . The group released a limited edition re-issue of John Travolta Wannabe , titled Roly-Poly in Copacabana , on August 2, 2011. The title track, "Roly-Poly in Copacabana", is a eurodance remix of "Roly-Poly", named after the song " Copacabana " which was popularized in the 80's in Jongno disco clubs. The album peaked at number three, while the single peaked at number forty and forty-five on the Gaon and Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 charts. The group began follow up promotions for the remixed single on Music Bank . T-ara released their debut Japanese single " Bo Peep Bo Peep " on September 28, which peaked at number one on the Oricon weekly singles chart with over 49.7 thousand copies sold, making them the first non-Japanese girl group to rank at number one for a debut single in Oricon history. The single peaked at number one on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 , and was certified Gold by the RIAJ for both full-length cellphone downloads and PC downloads. In November 2011, T-ara released their third extended play Black Eyes which charted at number two on the Gaon charts. The album was preceded by the release of "Cry Cry", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 and won two consecutive first-place awards on M Countdown . The music video for "Cry Cry" was noted for having a billion Korean won production budget and a thirty-minute drama story line. The group released their second Japanese single, a remake of " Yayaya " from their Temptastic EP, on November 30. The single peaked at number seven on the Oricon charts and number six on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 . In December 2011, Core Contents Media announced that T-ara's third leader Hyomin would be passing on her leadership to Soyeon .

T-ara and Davichi released their Christmastide ballad, "Uri Saranghaetjanha" (우리 사랑했잖아, "We Were in Love") on December 23, 2011; which was later included on T-ara's Funky Town re-release album. The single reached number one on the Gaon Chart and peaked at number two on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 .

After the concert, one member of T-ara tweeted a general message about determination, and four of the other members agreed with her. Subsequently, Hwayoung and her sister, Hyoyoung, tweeted about a "bad person," which gave Korean netizens the impression that there was a conflict within the group. Netizens retweeted the messages and speculated that Hwayoung was being bullied. When the bullying controversy got out of hand, Core Contents Media abruptly announced Hwayoung's immediate departure on July 30, after being with the group for one year and eight months. CCM's CEO, Kim Kwang-soo, claimed that Hwayoung's contract was terminated because staff members felt her behavior was hurting teamwork, and the bullying controversy was not the reason for her departure. The controversy caused the group to temporarily suspend activities, while the members continued with their individual activities. Both Hwayoung and the other members of T-ara have said that facts about their bullying issue were made-up by netizens, but on the other hand confirmed there was in fact a conflict between Hwayoung and the other members.

    rdfs:label "The_Rose" ;
    dbo:abstract " The Rose ( Korean : 더 로즈 ) is a South Korean band formed by J&Star Company. The band is composed of four members: Kim Woo-sung, Park Do-joon, Lee Ha-joon, and Lee Jae-hyeong. Prior to its debut with J&Star, the band had long been a popular indie group before making its official mainstream release with \"Sorry\" on August 3, 2017. Dojoon and Jaehyeong met as the two were busking in Hongdae. Often busy as a DSP Media trainee, Dojoon rarely had the time to meet with Jaehyeong and later confessed on a radio interview that he was not the type to disobey his management company. Jaehyeong started busking with Hajoon later in the year after the two met while practicing in the same studio, and the duo set out in search of another member. By the end of 2015, Jaehyeong recruited Dojoon, who had left his company and returned to busking. The trio started the indie band Windfall and began to write their own music, while posting musical covers on YouTube and performing in the streets. When the band decided to search for their fourth and final member, Dojoon worked to recruit Woosung, who he had met through a mutual friend. In 2016, the band entered J&Star Company. On August 3, 2017, the band debuted its mainstream single, \"Sorry\", penned by Hajoon [ citation needed ] and under a new name, The Rose. Later that month, the Rolling Stone India lauded The Rose's single for being \"a fantastic introduction to the band’s soft-rock vibe\" and described \"Woosung’s immense control over his raspy vocals... particularly impressive.\" The group then made a subsequent comeback on October 31 with its second single, \"Like We Used To.\" On December 14, Billboard named The Rose's \"Sorry\" as one of the best Korean pop songs of 2017. By this time, the music video had garnered over 3 million views on YouTube , a startling number for an amateur group. Later that month, the band announced its first European tour titled Paint It Rose, they performed in Brussels, Moscow, Istanbul, London and Budapest throughout the month of February 2018. Woosung later announced during a radio interview with Arirang K-Show that the tour had sold out. On December 24, the band hosted its first solo concert The Black Rose Day at the Mpot Hall in Seoul. The group performed its two existing singles, covers of English songs, and unreleased songs from the group's busking days titled \"Photographer\" and \"Beautiful Girl.\" On January 5, 2018, The Rose performed at the Rolling Hall 23rd Anniversary Concert, alongside other established indie artists such as Cheeze, O.WHEN, and Fromm. The band showcased three new unreleased songs, titled \"Baby,\" \"OMG,\" and \"ILY.\" On January 12, the band was listed as one of the top 5 Korean breakout artists to watch in 2018 by Billboard . The article wrote that it is \"rare for rock-leaning bands to make a major K-pop impression upon debut, but The Rose's gorgeously emotive \"Sorry\" was able to do that, scoring a spot on Billboard's year-end critics' song list and confirming themselves a multifaceted, new talent on the scene.\" On January 24, Soompi announced The Rose as one of the nominees for Rookie of the Year for its 13th Annual Soompi Awards. On March 17, the band headlined the closing ceremony concert of the 29th Korean American Students Conference, hosted by Northwestern University in Chicago. On April 16, The Rose released their first mini-album entitled Void . During their American tour, the group sat with Billboard to talk about their latest release: \"through the five-track effort, The Rose’s intent was to highlight the darker elements of human emotion through dynamic pop-rock.\" On August 14, The Rose was featured on the Tofu Personified (두부의 의인화) original soundtrack. \"With You\" (너와) was written, composed and arranged by Jaehyeong, with vocals performed by Woosung. On October 4, they released their second mini-album entitled Dawn . From May 17–19, 2019, The Rose performed for the first time at KCON Japan at Makuhari Messe in Chiba . On August 13, the band released their third single album Red . They subsequently embarked on their second world tour, We Rose You Live Tour, on August 17. On August 31, the band released the song \"Strangers\" (타인은 지옥이다) for the Hell Is Other People soundtrack. On January 15, 2020, it was announced that The Rose will be the opening act of Halsey 's Manic World Tour in Seoul on May 9. On February 28, 2020, The Rose reportedly filed a lawsuit against J&Star Company to terminate their exclusive contract. In their suit, the band alleged that the agency failed to provide any payment since their debut and that it demanded a rigorous promotional schedule. The Rose cited J&Star's pledge to provide them with monthly revenue reports which never materialized, as well as the company's unilateral decision to plan a 17-city American tour spanning 32 days, which would have required a concert every other day. J&Star Company denied the accusations and plan to \"take all necessary legal measures\". On March 4, 2020, J&Star Company released a secondary statement that refuted The Rose's claims and accusations against the company, saying the group was being deceptive, and broke integrity and dignity. The label stressed their intent to take counter legal actions for violation of contract, defamation of character, and more. Headlining concerts in Seoul Headlining tours " ;

    dbo:abstract "Tiny-G ( Korean : 타이니지 ) was a Korean group based in South Korea, formed in 2012 by GNG Production and unofficially disbanded in 2015. The group's last known line-up was the duo of J.Min and Dohee, but originally consisted of J.Min, Dohee, Mint and Myungji. Their name \"Tiny-G\" stands for \"Tiny Giant\" because \"even though they're small, with an average height of 153cm, they are strong and fierce like giants\". Before debut, the group appeared on MBC 's show Show Champion on April 24, 2012 and performed the track “Polaris”, a song which singer Jay Park and actress Lee Si-young had made for them as a gift through MBC's Music and Lyrics . The instrumentation was composed and produced by Cha Cha Malone and Jay Park . The song was titled \"Polaris\" and was released on May 5. After \"Music & Lyrics\" was broadcast, Tiny-G became the number 1 searched item on many Korean search engines. Their debut single \"Tiny-G\" was released on August 23, 2012. They made their debut on M! Countdown with \"Tiny-G\". The group released their second single, \"Minimanimo\" on January 20, 2013. On June 13, 2013, the group performed an OST for the game Dragon Nest titled \"Here We Go\", and on October 1, 2013, they released their third single, \"Miss You\". On March 12, 2014, Dohee and J-Min performed an OST for the drama Cunning Single Lady titled \"Mirror Mirror\". On June 26, GnG Production announced that Myungji was leaving to focus on her acting career. They released a statement saying \"Myungji expressed that she wants to officially go into acting to expand on her passion that she's had since her child actress and CF days... Myungji's leave was decided on after discussing it fully with the agency and Tiny-G members, and we respect and cheer on her decision.\" Tiny-G came back as a trio on July 3 with the song \"Ice Baby\". On November 3, 2014, it was revealed that Tiny-G would be debuting their first sub-unit under the name of \"Tiny-G M\" featuring members J.Min and Mint. Promoting mainly in Thailand, the sub-unit released their first single, \"The Only One\", featuring Thai artist Natthew. The music video was released November 25 and featured appearances by Natthew and Tiny-G member Dohee. On February 12, 2015, rumours began to circulate that the group had disbanded. GNG Production denied the rumours, instead announcing that the group was going on indefinite hiatus as members explored individual opportunities. On April 7, 2016, it was revealed that Mint was under a new label - JSL Entertainment - and was preparing for a solo debut, sparking disbandment rumours. As Tiny-G's official page on GNG's website has been removed, their official fancafe has not been updated in two years and Dohee is the sole member featured on the company's website, it can be presumed that they have disbanded. On April 16, 2017, Dohee participated in an episode of \"King of Masked Singer\". Although she was eliminated from the competition, the judges praised her singing skills. On April 28, Mint's new drama THE iDOLM@STER.KR began airing, and she appeared in the attached girl group \"Real Girls Project\". On June 30, it was announced that former member Myungji would be taking part in the reality girl group survival show \" Idol School \" on Mnet. " ;

    dbo:abstract " UNVS ( Korean : 유엔브이에스 ; Chinese : UNIVERSE 世界少年 ) is an idol group based in South Korea. Formed by Media Asia Music, the original lineup consisted of Sihoon, IL, Changgong, Yongyong, and Minho. The quintet first debuted in Taiwan, where they released the digital singles \"Uni-verse\" and \"Hacker\" in 2016 and 2017, respectively. UNVS signed with Chitwn Music in its home country with founding members Changgyu (formerly Changgong) and YY (Yongyong), and new additions Jun H., Eunho, and Jen. They released their debut single album Debut Single: Timeless and its lead single \"Timeless\" domestically on February 23, 2020. Universe (UNVS), which also serves as a portmanteau of \"unique\" and \" verse \", was formed in South Korea by Media Asia Music. They decided on the name in hopes of having \"universal appeal\" and becoming a \"pop group beloved by the people\". The initial lineup compromised South Korean leader and main vocalist Sihoon, vocalist Changgong, and dancer Minho, as well as Chinese rapper IL and vocalist Yongyong; the quintet trained together for one year. UNVS spent the first three months of their career in Taiwan to establish a following of Chinese speakers. Their first single \"Uni-verse\" was written by lyricist Francis Lee and digitally released on December 21, 2016. UNVS became the first Korean idol group to make their debut in the country. They released their second single \"Hacker\" on January 1, 2017. UNVS departed from Taiwan two months later and were scheduled to debut in their home country and Japan later that year. Leader and rapper Jun H., main vocalist Eunho, and rapper Jen joined UNVS alongside YY (formerly Yongyong) and Changgyu (Changgong). The group signed with Chitwn Music in South Korea and the company introduced the quintet by publishing a promotional poster on February 9, 2020. SBS MTV rebooted its television series Rookie King after seven years and featured UNVS in midst of their domestic debut. UNVS released their debut single album Debut Single: Timeless and its lead single \"Timeless\" on February 23, 2020. In response to the decision of South Korea's government to upgrade the alert level to its highest amidst the coronavirus pandemic , the record label followed the recommendation to avoid gathering people and canceled UNVS's scheduled showcase for reporters the following day; the event was live streamed without an audience instead.

However, Ravi intends to continue be a part of VIXX.
As for N who is currently serving in the military, the label plans to discuss the possibility of contract renewal following his discharge. The members are heavily involved in the development of their concepts and their "commitment to concept is especially impressive with live performances of songs". Micah Levin Isla from The Philippine Star commented, "You can be someone who'll never be truly on board with this whole K-Pop craze. But there's something about VIXX that's really fascinating and intriguing. Their music and appeal have this lingering effect." VIXX has cemented a "niche in the theatrical side of K-pop" with performances that follow a storyline that is carefully put together. In a review of one of their concerts, journalist Park Jung Sun commented, "They presented live performances which broke prejudices people have towards idols. VIXX presented a musical-like stage as coming off from the-usual-concert which displays singing and dancing. VIXX led their fans to UTOPIA that they constructed". With many of their releases, VIXX has tackled themes such as hope, dreams, falling madly in love with a girl although it hurts, such in the songs " On and On " ( Korean : 다칠 준비가 돼 있어 ), which literally translates into "I'm Ready to Get Hurt", " Voodoo Doll " and " Chained Up "; breaking up with their lovers " Love Equation ", "Don't Want to Be An Idol"'; generally sad or dark love songs, with the themes of obsession and insanity such as the songs " Hyde " and " G.R.8.U "; and emotional breakdown in " Error " and the timelessness of love in " Eternity ". Most, if not all of their songs, play on the depth of raw human emotion. VIXX plays an active role producing their music, with all members participating in the ideas and concepts. Majority of the members have an active role in their music. Ravi , Leo , Hyuk and most recently N and Ken play an active role in composition and lyric-writing of their songs. Reality TV Shows In 2012, VIXX became the Goodwill Ambassadors for The Salvation Army as a part of the 2012 Salvation Army Christmas Kettle , with the 14th of December 2012 as their Kettle Day—a date which was chosen by fans. [ citation needed ] In November 2013, VIXX along with Boys Republic became ambassadors for "Eye Camp Expedition," a charity campaign, joining other volunteers in Vietnam to help those visually impaired. Their charity work was documented through a four episodes reality show aired on SBS MTV. In 2014, VIXX became the official ambassadors at the Korea & Korean brand Commodities Fair (KBEE) in Sao Paulo , Brazil . In 2015, VIXX helped Daehwan, a fan of the group who had muscular dystrophy , to see the VIXX Live Fantasia – Utopia concert after Daehwan's mother started a Twitter account and tweeted to VIXX. Enough money was donated to the fund to allow Daehwan travel to and from the concert venue safely, and provided a bed for him to lie upon. Daehwan met with VIXX after the concert.

Billboard stated: \"The rawness of human emotion is relayed through intense scenes acted out by the group's members. Feelings of being stomped on and tied up by emotions and those around you are acted out, as is the idea of baring it all, a rarity in the K-pop world, while emotions such as lethargy, anger and melancholy are expressed through a variety of moments splintered across the screen\". Through this comeback, Winner once again pushed out of the boundaries of \"K-pop\" and done what is considered an \"anomaly\" within the industry, something also previously done by labelmate 2NE1 through single \"Missing You\".

The studio album entitled Remember contains 8 new songs, with lead single of the same name, \"Remember\" alongside 4 re-recorded songs from debut album 2014 S/S . Remember marks their last release until all members complete their mandatory enlistment. Through multiple releases, Winner acquired the term ' Trust and Listen' among the general public of South Korea. The term originated as the public recognized the group's potential in creating high quality music accordingly for the mass audience, and so just by the mention of the group's name, they will willingly listen to the songs with no complaint.

Through interviews and social media platforms, members Tag and Hong Joo-chan of boy group Golden Child cited Winner as role models they look up to and is often influenced by them on multiple occasions throughout their career. For instance, Tag also once revealed he especially admired and respected Winner member Lee Seung-hoon since his K-pop Star days.

Former JBJ member Jin Longguo mentioned Winner as his role model while explaining within the music industry, some attract attention for their outer appearance in comparison to their musicality, further adding that Winner is a group that he believes has a good balance of both thus wishes to also follow these traits.

On April 18, 2018, the Korean Culture and Information Service (KOCIS) , part of the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism announced Winner as its official campaign model for the global 'Talk Talk Korea 2018' contest. The contest gathered the most participants ever since its launch in 2014. On May 12, Winner joined Kiehl's on its third campaign held to protect nature inside cities with the #MyLittleGarden project.

    rdfs:label "XENO-T" ;
    dbo:abstract " Xeno-T ( Korean : 제노티 ) is a South Korean boy group formerly known as Topp Dogg . The group consists of five members: Hojoon, Sangdo, B-Joo, Xero and Sangwon. Originally a thirteen-member group created by Cho PD in 2013 under Stardom Entertainment , the group moved to Hunus Entertainment, following Stardom Entertainment's merger with the company. After multiple line-up changes, the remaining five members subsequently changed their name to XENO-T in 2018. As Topp Dogg, the group released one studio album, four EPs , three repackages, eight singles and had three soundtrack appearances. Mixtapes were released in March and April 2012 to promote the group before debut. The members were officially introduced in October 2013 and the group held a debut showcase on October 22, 2013. On October 22, 2013, they released their debut music video for lead single \"Follow Me (말로해)\", and a day later released their debut EP , Dogg's Out . Topp Dogg released a repackaged version of Dogg's Out on December 12, which included the title track \"Cigarette\" and a Chinese version of \"Follow Me\". On January 13, 2014, Stardom Entertainment released a teaser for Topp Dogg's second EP. On January 15, Topp Dogg made their comeback with the release of the music video to title track \"Open the Door\" and a second song entitled Arario was released the next day. The music video for \"Arario\" was released on February 12, serving as the title track of their repackaged EP, which was released February 24. On June 9, it was revealed that Topp Dogg would be releasing their third EP, AmadeuS , with the title track \"TOPDOG\". However, a few days before the release, the entire album was leaked on the internet. The label attempted to remove the songs, and later took legal action against the culprit. On August 25, Topp Dogg released a repackage of AmadeuS with three new tracks and a short film showing fans the behind the scenes footage of the AmadeuS photoshoot. [ citation needed ] For their first anniversary, Topp Dogg released a new \"old school\" song, \"Annie\" (short for \"Anniversary\"), on October 16. After months of Seogoong seemingly being on hiatus, he posted a message on Twitter and on Topp Dogg's official fancafe, revealing that he would be moving from Topp Dogg to its sub-unit \"Under Dogg\" so that he could \"cover a broader musical spectrum\". He began working under the sub-unit on January 16. Concerts for their American tour were held in Houston, Texas; Miami Beach, Florida; and Atlanta, Georgia during February 2015. As of July 2015, Topp Dogg was moved to Hunus Entertainment after their former company Stardom Entertainment had been acquired and merger by Hunus Entertainment. [ citation needed ] On October 8, Hunus Entertainment released a statement after numerous rumors were surfacing over Kidoh and Gohn filing lawsuits against the company for \"mismanagement of their careers\" as the two members wanted to expand their careers. The statement confirmed the rumors that Gohn and Kidoh had both tried to file lawsuits against the company Before the release of their fourth EP, Hunus Entertainment released four teaser videos over the course of two weeks leading up to the release date of \"Emotion\", \"O.A.S.I.S\", \"All Eyez on Me\", and \"The Beat\". On October 19, Topp Dogg released their fourth EP, The Beat , along with a music video for the title track of the same name. The EP peaked at number 22 on the Gaon Album Chart, selling 3,000+ copies. [ citation needed ] On March 3, Topp Dogg released an OST for the TV series Come Back Mister ; the track was also given a music video featuring the members recording the song. Two more songs were released for the drama by Topp Dogg members—the first being \"Back Then\" by Hojoon, released on March 31, and the second being \"You\" by Hojoon and Sangdo, released on April 7. [ citation needed ] Topp Dogg's rap line (Yano, A-Tom and Jenissi) took part in season five of the popular rap survival show, Show Me the Money , which began airing in May. A-Tom passed the audition process and made it to round two where he was eliminated. Shortly after A-Tom released a song to his SoundCloud entitled \"So Blind\", which was later uploaded to Hunus Entertainment's YouTube account on May 20. Both Yano and Jenissi failed to pass the audition round. [ citation needed ] It was announced in May that Topp Dogg would be taking part in a web series created by K-Pop news website Soompi called Topp Dogg: All-Kill . The show ran for 10 episodes, from May 23 to August 15, and aired on Mondays—it featured the members taking part in various \"challenges\" every week, such as cooking and charades, and featured special segments such as a dorm tour. On October 31, they released a comeback teaser for their first studio album First Street , as nine members instead of the previous ten. Jenissi was revealed to have left the group to pursue a solo career. The teaser of \"Rainy Day\" was released on October 31. The album along with the music video for the title track were released on November 7, 2016. On February 28, 2017 Hunus Entertainment announced that A-Tom had temporary left the group to participate in Produce 101 Season 2 under his birth name, Kim Sang-gyun. He was eliminated in 26th place during the third elimination round. On September 29, Hunus Entertainment released a statement on the group's fan cafe, announcing that five members (Sangdo, Xero, B-Joo, Yano, and Hojoon) would be participating in the reality television series The Unit . A-Tom was announced to be debuting with the Produce 101 fan-created group, JBJ and his future activities with Topp Dogg had remained to be discussed after his activities with JBJ came to an end. Following promotions for their first studio album, First Street , Hansol, P-Goon and Nakta were revealed to have left the group. Hansol intended to join the military. His contract with Hunus is to be discussed once he is discharged. P-Goon also planned to enlist in the military, with plans to pursue an acting career upon being discharged. Nakta had decided to terminate his contract to pursue a solo career. In October 2017, the remaining five members joined the audition process for The Unit , with only Hojoon and B-Joo passing. Hojoon was eliminated in 39th place during the second elimination round while, B-Joo was eliminated in 25th place during the third elimination round. On February 21, it was announced via Topp Dogg's official fan cafe that the group were starting fresh, as a new group under the name of Xeno-T. The name is a combination of \"xenogeneic\" and \"top-class\", the latter being a tribute to their fandom, \"ToppKlass\". The post revealed that the group wanted a new start to showcase themselves better as a group and show new sides to themselves. It was also announced that B-Joo would be changing the Korean writing of his stage name, and that Yano would now be promoting under his birth name, Sangwon. Hunus later confirmed that A-Tom would not be joining the group once his activities with JBJ came to an end. XENO-T officially debuted in Japan with their first Japanese single, \"どこにいても\" (Wherever You Are) on May 30, along with the release of the music video. " ;

Jonghyun regards Japan as his second home since he spent so much time there with his family. Jonghyun was always a fan of music and often listened to American rock music. He once saw Eric Clapton and decided that the life of a musician was the life he wanted to live. So, he enrolled in guitar classes and learned to play very quickly. During his middle school days, he also entered into martial arts but he knew music was his true passion. In 2007 Jonghyun auditioned for FNC Entertainment. He passed his audition and met some fellow musicians who would later be his band-mates. He then began his training at the FNC Academy. By 2009, CNBLUE had been formed and the group traveled to Japan to study music and see what kind of music audiences would like. The group would play live shows on the streets and they gained a good response from the Japanese public. This is when they began working on their debut album.

Hyelin had wanted to be a singer from a young age, she was so passionate about this dream that once when her father implied she couldn't do it, she didn't speak to him for months after. She joined in 2011 but failed to advance. After audition and training with EXID's original company, she was going to be a member of the original lineup of EXID but was cut from the lineup before debut. However after three members left, she was added to the lineup (for her vocals and dancing) alongside former vocal coach to create the five-member group known since then. In 2016, EXID promoted their first full album . It was on this album that the long awaited duo of Hyelin and Jeonghwa would come with the song \"Are You Hungry?\". Other than this bright and quirky track, Hyelin only participated in group tracks for this album. Due to Solji's thyroid condition, Hyelin had to take over main vocalist responsibilities in EXID's songs and performances. Because she was the only member with enough skill in her upper range to stand in for Solji, she had to sing Solji's parts in their older songs. She also had to take over all adlibs of new songs. EXID's first promotions without Solji began with the title track \"Night Rather Than Day\" from their third mini album where the music is more chill and less exciting than their normal music. EXID came back with \"DDD\" and the mini album in November of the same year and with that album came a solo track for Hyelin which she participated in writing for. The solo track was called \"Foolish\" and was Hyelin's first solo work since joining EXID. EXID first promoted in 2018 in April with the single album \" \". This song and it's promotions caused Hyelin's popularity to rise more than ever before as she sings the highest note to be in an EXID song on it, and because of her newly long and straight black hair. Her dance skills were also shown off much more in this comeback than previous comebacks, as legs and footwork were more emphasized and this is something Hyelin is much more comfortable with and good at than their normal sexy style of dancing that emphasizes their hips. On January 15, 2020, a Banana Culture source confirmed to local news outlet that Hyelin's contract with the company had come to an end and she decided not to renew it." ;
