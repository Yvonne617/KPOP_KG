The group consisted of five members at the time of its debut in 2007: Sunye , Sohee , Hyuna , Sunmi and Yeeun . Shortly after, in the same year, Hyuna left the group due to concerns over her health, which led to the addition of Yubin as replacement. In 2010, Sunmi left the group to pursue an academic career, and trainee Hyerim was selected as her replacement. Sohee departed from the group in late 2013 following the expiration of her contract with JYP Entertainment, while Sunye left the group in late 2014; their departures were officially announced in July 2015. For the group's 2015 comeback, Sunmi returned to the group, and served as a member alongside Yeeun, Yubin, and Hyerim; the Wonder Girls remained as four-piece band until their disbandment in 2017.\n"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_(South_Korean_band)", "name": "Kara (South Korean group)", "labels": ["DSP"], "intro": "Kara ( Hangul : \uce74\ub77c, Japanese : \u30ab\u30e9, often stylized as KARA ) / \u02c8 k \u0251\u02d0r \u0259 / was a South Korean pop girl group formed by DSP Media in 2007. The group's final lineup was composed of Park Gyuri , Han Seungyeon , Goo Hara and Heo Youngji . Members Nicole Jung and Kang Ji-young officially departed from the group in 2014, while Kim Sung-hee left in 2008. The group originally started off as a quartet and made their debut with \"Break It\" (2007) while displaying a strong female image and a mature R&B sound. Expectations for the group were big because they were considered as successors to their senior labelmate, Fin.K.L . They released their first studio album titled The First Blooming in March 2007. However, their debut was not well received by the public and was a commercial failure. The following year, Kim Sung-hee departed the group due to parental pressure, and members Goo Hara and Kang Jiyoung were brought in. After their addition, the group also changed their musical style and their image to the \"pretty but natural\" appeal, releasing their first mini-album, Rock U in July 2008. They achieved their first number one song with \" Honey \" (2009). In July 2009, the group released their second studio album, Revolution and spawned the hit single \" Mister \", whose choreography featured the \"butt-dance\", that helped increase the group's popularity within East Asia. Their follow-up singles including \" Lupin \" (2010), \" Jumping \" (2010), \" Step \" (2011), and \"Pandora\" (2012) were also successful and helped further establish the group within the Korean music industry. The group were ranked at No. 6 and No. 5 in Gallup Korea in 2009 and 2010 respectively, thus making them the second best girl group in Korea for 2010. They were also ranked at No. 4 and 13 in February 2012 and 2013's Forbes Korea Power Celebrity list. After finding national success, the group began to expand their music to Japan by signing to Universal Music Japan 's subsidiary label, Universal Sigma in 2010. The group's debut was a success as they were dubbed as \"Japan's No. 1 Rookie Artist of 2010\" by Oricon and also receiving the \"New Artist of the Year Award (International)\" from the Japan Gold Disc Awards . In April 2011, the group achieved their first number one single in Japan with \" Jet Coaster Love \", making them the first foreign female group since the creation of the Oricon to rank number one in the first week of release and also the first foreign female group in thirty years to do so. Overall, the group managed to sell over one million physical singles within two years, making them one of the fastest-selling South Korean acts in Japan. In 2014, Nicole Jung and Kang Jiyoung decided not to renew their contracts with DSP Media thus leaving the group to pursue their own endeavors; Nicole debuted as solo artist and Jiyoung became an actress in Japan. Following their departures, a reality show titled Kara Project was aired on TV to select members to join the group. Seven trainees from DSP Media took part in the program. The winner of the competition was Heo Youngji who became the latest member to join the group. On January 15, 2016, Kara disbanded after DSP Media announced that the contracts with Park Gyu-ri, Han Seung-yeon and Goo Ha-ra expired and they decided not to renew their contracts. Members Gyuri and Youngji have mentioned the possibilities of reunion, though no further updates have been released. The group's name comes from the Greek word \"chara\" (\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac, lit. \"joy\"), which they interpreted to mean \"sweet melody\". The group started off as a quartet with members consisting of Park Gyuri , Han Seung-yeon , Kim Sung-hee, and Jung Nicole . The group debuted on March 29, 2007 with \"Break It\" on M.net 's M! Countdown from their first album The First Blooming while displaying a strong female image and R&B sound. The album also produced the singles \"If U Wanna\" and \"Secret World\". Music videos for the first two singles were created. They were often compared to their senior labelmates, Fin.K.L , because of their similarity and the fact that the two groups were signed to the same label. Additionally, each individual member of Kara was paralleled to a member of Fin.K.L. In response to the comparisons, the group stated that they regarded the comparison as beneficial and inspiring. Although their album was acclaimed by critics, it was not well received by the general public and was overshadowed by other girl groups who debuted the same year. All promotions for their first album ended in the summer of 2007. In August 2007, the group came out with a documentary on M.net called Kara Self Camera which showcased the group and their talents, as well as the relationship they had with each other. The first season debuted on August 8, 2007, and chronicled the lives of the girls over 15 episodes, ending on December 12, 2007. As their first album was not a commercial success, member Seungyeon participated in many television variety shows in the following months to keep the group's name recognizable to the public. The group was scheduled to have their comeback in March 2008 with their second album, however, member Kim Sung-hee suddenly announced that she would be leaving the group due to parental pressure because her participation in the group was contingent on the maintenance of her grades. In response, DSP stated that the second album that was recorded would be shelved and replaced by a mini-album to come in May; in addition, two members would join the group. Auditions were held, and the two new members were eventually revealed to be Goo Ha-ra and Kang Jiyoung .

During their first national performance on KBS 's Music Bank , member Goo Hara accidentally gasped \"ah!\" live on air due to slipping on falling confetti, and reportedly cried profusely afterwards. The incident became a hot issue to many viewers, but Goo Hara received comfort instead of criticism from the general public. Park Gyuri attributed their popularity increase to their \"pretty but natural\" appeal, while media reports gave credit to the band for finally finding its own identity in the music industry since the group's debut and to older male fans, most notably singer Shin Hae Chul . Due to their increasingly hectic schedule as their popularity rose, a few of the group's members were taken to the hospital on December 19 after a Music Bank rehearsal for cold symptoms and exhaustion.

The dolls were sold in South Korea and Japan. They were produced by professionals from Hot Toys, DC Comics, Nokia, and Enterbay.

On June 18, 2012, the group released their own premium fragrance line called \"K5J\", an acronym for \"Kara 5 Jewel\" and members participated in the development of the perfume from the beginning.

On January 19, 2011, a lawyer representing four of the five Kara members announced to the media that they would be terminating their contract with DSP Entertainment, effective immediately; a lawsuit was also filed on their behalf. Park Gyuri, the leader of the group, was the only one remaining with their management company. In one statement, the lawyer representing the four stated that \"the company repeatedly denied any requests and unilaterally forced tasks upon the members\", and that they have been preparing for legal action for two months. Later that day, it was announced that Goo Hara would discontinue her involvement with the lawsuit and has rejoined the company, as she apparently was not fully aware of the lawsuit's details. In a statement, DSP Entertainment firmly rebutted all accusations, also stating that they wished to resolve the issues and reconcile with the members quickly. DSP also denied earlier reports of denying Kara members their fair share of profits, stating that each member was paid \u20a9 300,000,000 for their work. The lawyer for the three remaining members released another statement giving further details of their allegations. Their representatives stated that they were misinformed regarding their Japanese promotions, and that their relationship with the company severely deteriorated with the hospitalization of CEO Lee Ho-yeon in March 2010. On April 28, 2011, the dispute between DSP Entertainment and Kara's 3 members (Han Seung-yeon, Nicole Jung, Kang Ji-young) was finally resolved. But two years later, in October 2013, DSP released statement that Nicole would not be renewing her contract with DSP Media upon its termination in January 2014. Seungyeon, Gyuri and Hara all renewed their contracts for a further two years, and Jiyoung is taking her time to decide whether or not to study abroad, as her contract doesn't end until April 2014. However, it was confirmed later on by Nicole through her Twitter account that they are still in the midst of discussing and resolving the contract issues as Nicole still wants to work as a member of KARA while managed by a different agency. Alongside Nicole's contract issue, DSP Media however has revealed that \"Because Kang Ji Young contract expires in April next year, she has decided to think over her future.\" An exclusive report from news outlet OSEN however had shed a bit more light regarding her circumstances with the news outlet claiming that Kang Ji Young was leaning towards making a decision to go abroad to study. The report claimed that while she wasn't outright saying that she wanted to leave the group, she had stated that she needed a certain amount of time to rest. On January 14, Jiyoung had officially made her decision to leave Kara once her contract expires in April 2014. Jiyoung's father stated that it will be difficult, but is necessary for Jiyoung so she may leave DSP to pursue her dreams. On February 2, 2012, DSP Media refuted accusations that the man who followed Kara during their time in Japan was a Chongryon-affiliated North Korean agent but was actually their schedule manager.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Generation", "name": "Girls' Generation", "labels": ["SM", "EMI Japan", "Interscope"], "intro": " Girls' Generation ( Korean : \uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 ; RR : Sonyeo Sidae ), also known as SNSD , is a South Korean girl group formed by SM Entertainment . The group is composed of eight members: Taeyeon , Sunny , Tiffany , Hyoyeon , Yuri , Sooyoung , Yoona , and Seohyun . Originally a nine-piece group, Jessica departed from the group in September 2014. One of the prominent figures of the Korean Wave , the group has earned numerous accolades and the honorific nickname \"The Nation's Girl Group\" in their home country. Girls' Generation debuted in August 2007 with their eponymous Korean album and the single \" Into the New World \". The group rose to fame in 2009 with the single \" Gee \", which claimed the top spot on KBS 's Music Bank for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was Melon 's most popular song of the 2000s decade. Girls' Generation consolidated their popularity in South Korea with follow-up singles \" Genie \", \" Oh! \", and \" Run Devil Run \", which were released between mid-2009 and early 2010. Their second Korean studio album, Oh! (2010), won the Golden Disc award for Album of the Year, making the group the only female act to win the grand prize so far. The group ventured into the Japanese music scene in 2011 with their eponymous Japanese album , which became the first album by a non-Japanese girl group to be certified million by the RIAJ . The group's third Korean studio album, The Boys , was the best-selling album of 2011 in South Korea. An English version of the single \" The Boys \" was released in an attempt to expand the group's endeavor to the global music scene. The group's fourth Korean studio album, I Got a Boy (2013), was supported by the title track , which won Video of the Year at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards . Girls' Generation released their fifth Korean studio album, Lion Heart in 2015, followed by Holiday Night in 2017. The group's signature musical styles are characterized as electropop and bubblegum pop , though their sounds have varied widely, incorporating various genres including hip hop , R&B , and EDM . In 2017, Billboard honoured Girls' Generation as the \"Top K-pop Girl Group of the Past Decade\". They are the first Asian girl group to achieve five music videos with over 100 million views on YouTube with \"Gee\", \"I Got a Boy\", \"The Boys\", \" Mr. Taxi \", and \"Oh!\". In Japan, they became the first non-Japanese girl group to have three number-one albums on the Oricon Albums Chart with their eponymous album, Love & Peace , and The Best , and their three Japanese concert tours attracted a record-breaking 550,000 spectators. The group's Korean name is So-nyuh Shi-dae ( Korean : \uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 , RR : Sonyeo Sidae ), from the Sino-Korean root meaning \"Generation of Girls\"; they are also known as SoShi (Korean: \uc18c\uc2dc ) or SNSD , both of which are abbreviated forms of the group's Korean-language name. Because their name consists of Chinese roots, the group's name is similar in Chinese and Japanese: in Japan the group's name is pronounced as Sh\u014djo Jidai (Japanese: \u5c11\u5973\u6642\u4ee3), and in Mandarin Chinese as Sh\u00e0on\u01da Sh\u00edd\u00e0i (Chinese: \u5c11\u5973\u6642\u4ee3/\u5c11\u5973\u65f6\u4ee3). Prior to the group's debut, some of the members were already involved in the entertainment industry. Yoona had gone through about 200 auditions for music videos, dramas, and movies before becoming a singer for Girls' Generation. Sooyoung was exposed to the Japanese music scene as a member of a pop duo named Route \u03b8, which disbanded one year after its debut in 2002. The first member of the group to join SM Entertainment 's training system was Jessica in 2000, after she and her sister, Krystal Jung , were scouted in a mall in South Korea during a family vacation. That same year, members Sooyoung and Hyoyeon were cast into S.M.'s training system through the 2000 S.M. Open Audition, in which Hyoyeon danced for her audition. Yuri was the next Girls' Generation member to become an S.M. trainee after coming second in the 2001 S.M. Youth Best Dancer competition. Yoona was cast the following year through the 2002 S.M. Saturday Open Casting Audition, where she sang and danced to her favorite singers, BoA and Britney Spears . Seohyun , the group's youngest member, was scouted in the subway by an S.M. scout; she then auditioned in 2003, singing children's songs. The group's leader, Taeyeon , was cast in 2004 after winning first place in the S.M. Youth Singing Competition. That same year, member Tiffany auditioned at S.M.'s Starlight Casting System in Los Angeles, and joined the company in October 2004. The final member of the group to be added was Sunny , who had become an S.M. trainee in 1998 and trained for five years before moving to another company, Starworld.

Since 2016, Hyoyeon has also released several solo singles both under her given name and her DJ Hyo moniker. On December 2018, Sooyoung released \"Winter Breath\", her first solo single since departing from SM Entertainment. Girls' Generation's music is predominantly bubblegum pop and electropop . The group's early singles such as \"Gee\", \"Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)\" (2009), and \"Oh!\" (2010) are described as \"cutesy\" bubblegum pop; \"Gee\" also features elements of techno and hip hop , as noted by Abigail Covington from The A.V. Club . Nevertheless, the group's musical styles have varied widely ever since; Anzhe Zhang from the New York University wrote that despite the fact that Girls' Generation's styles are deemed \"mainstream\" in South Korea, the group \"has grown sonically more experimental.\" Their 2011 single \"The Boys\" departs for a more \"mature\" style from the group's previous emphasis on \"cutesy\" themes; it incorporates elements from hip hop, a genre that Girls' Generation had never ventured into. The titular studio album, according to AllMusic 's reviewer Tim Sendra, includes uptempo dance tracks \"with a straight pop radio feel.\" Girls' Generation's 2012 single \"Dancing Queen\"\u2014a remake of British singer Duffy's \"Mercy\" (2008)\u2014features a \" funky pop \" production, as opposed to the group's signature electropop sound. Their 2013 single \"I Got a Boy\" was noted for its eclectic musical style, utilizing various genres ranging from bubblegum pop, electropop and drum and bass to pop-rap , EDM , and dubstep . Jeff Benjamin from Billboard lauded the song as \"one of the most-forward thinking lead pop singles heard in any country.\" Both aforementioned singles' parent album, I Got a Boy (2013), combines elements from a wide range of genres such as 1980s new wave , EDM, and classic and contemporary R&B . Girls' Generation's 2014 EP, Mr.Mr. , features \"exciting\" R&B sounds with \"cool, simple\" melodies. AllMusic's Heather Phares also noted inspirations of EDM, hip hop, traditional K-pop sound, and late-1980s europop on the EP, which she labelled \"a set of songs that offers something for every kind of Girls' Generation and expands their musical reach.\" The group's 2015 album Lion Heart brings back their signature bubblegum pop sound; its third single \"You Think\", however, is a hip hop song that incorporates trap beats in its instrumentation. Although most Girls' Generation's releases are written by songwriters for S.M. Entertainment, some members occasionally participated in songwriting. Member Yuri wrote the lyrics for \"Mistake\" from their 2010 EP Hoot . Sooyoung penned the lyrics to \"How Great Is Your Love\" on the group's 2011 studio album The Boys . Members Sooyoung, Yuri, and Seohyun wrote the lyrics for \"Baby Maybe\" and \"XYZ\" on the group's 2013 studio album I Got a Boy . The group's main lyrical themes as characterized by Chris True from AllMusic are \"dance party\" and \"girls night out.\" Girls' Generation's songs have been criticized by Western media outlets for not portraying female empowerment but promoting the opposite. Ceejay Lee from feminist magazine Fem criticized the \"generic\" themes of Korean girl groups like Wonder Girls or Girls' Generation as \"sexist\": \"[They] infantilize themselves to emasculate males by pandering childlike, puritanical innocence [...] It only reinforces that females are weak beings that serve to gratify males and that males need to be 'man' enough to 'protect' them.\" Stephen Epstein from the Victoria University of Wellington and James Turnbull from Dongseo University expressed concern that the lyrics of K-pop girl groups may raise considerable questions about the empowering nature of \"Girl Group Fever\"\u2014particularly with singles \"Gee\" and \"Oh!\" Writing for The Harvard Crimson , Soyoung Kim wrote that \"the representation of females in K-pop has been problematic\" and singled out Girls' Generation's \"Gee\" as an embodiment; its repetitive lyrics \"What should I do?\" ( \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c? ), \"fool\" ( \ubc14\ubcf4 ), or \"I don't know\" ( \ubab0\ub77c ) suggest that the girls are \"utterly clueless children\" who \"dumb [themselves] down\" just to attract a partner. He further cited the single \"I Got a Boy\" as an epitome of the group's non-empowering lyrics, with lines such as \"I got a boy, he's awesome / I got a boy, he's kind / I got a boy, handsome boy, my heart's been taken away [...] My prince! / When will you rescue me?\" Kim came to the conclusion that \"female K-pop artists orient themselves around men in order to gain attention.\" Despite the criticism, several of Girls' Generation's songs, such as \"Run Devil Run\", \"Hoot\", and \"Bad Girl\" (from their 2011 eponymous Japanese album) are noted for portraying \"confident young women with their own opinion\", which is a departure from their early singles. The group's 2011 single \"The Boys\" was noted for conveying a feminist theme and was compared to Beyonc\u00e9 's 2011 single \" Run the World (Girls) \" for the same \"women-powered\" content; Eun-Young Jun in the book The Korean Wave: Korean Media Go Global (2013) noted its lyrics for depicting \"sexually daring women\" who are confident in their sexuality. Girls' Generation is known for reinventing their fashion styles and stage performances throughout their career. In their early years, the group performed in uniforms; with the debut single \"Into the New World\", they introduced themselves as high school students. In 2009, the group set the \"colorful skinny jeans\" fashion trend with \"Gee\", and later opted for a marine-inspired image on wearing uniforms and shorts that highlighted their legs with \"Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)\". In 2010, the group's image became more diverse: they used a cheerleader concept for \"Oh!\", while the performances of their 2010 single \"Run Devil Run\" was noted for conveying a darker theme, which was billed \"Black SoShi\". Later that year, the group transformed themselves to Bond Girls -inspired singers for the visual of \"Hoot\". In 2011, the group established a \"heroine\" image, with members choosing their own outfits, emphasizing each of the members' own tastes rather than performing in uniforms. For the performances of \"I Got a Boy\" (2013), the members opted for flat shoes instead of their signature high heels in order to perform the choreography correctly. Girls' Generation's visuals for their 2015 singles \"Catch Me If You Can\" and \"You Think\" were noted for intricate choreography moves with a more \"powerful\" and \"sexy\" image. Girls' Generation's image has often been regarded as \"innocent\", and their performances onstage are described as \"youthful\" and \"colorful;\" Ceejay Lee from Fem commented that Girls' Generation's outfits often reveal legs rather than \"cleavages or derri\u00e8res.\" Eun-Young Jung in the book The Korean Wave opined that the group's concepts fall into two main categories\u2014\"innocent, cutesy, happy\" (early singles \"Gee\", \"Genie\", \"Oh!\") and \"more mature, yet not overly sexy, feminine\" (later singles \"Run Devil Run\" and \"Hoot\"). A writer for the Korean Culture and Information Service deemed the group's image as \"sexy\" and \"girly\" \"goddesses that are hard to approach.\" John Seabrook from The New Yorker described Girls' Generation as \"a group of preppy-looking young women in skinny trousers. When they wear hot pants, it's to display the gams, not the glutes.\" New York Magazine stated: \"according to label executives and fans, [Girls' Generation's] appeal is not their music, which is catchy but derivative. Instead, the [group projects] a humility that gives their fans the illusion that 'when you see them on stage it's like they've come to see you.' \" Taylor Glasby from Dazed remarked that not only the group's early \"pure\" image and music were appealing, but the members' personalities as a whole \"uniquely solidified the GG experience into an intimate family affair,\" noting that their supporters look up to all the members as \"sisters, role models and icons.\" Discussing the public's scrutiny on the group's physical image, member Tiffany remarked: Girls' Generation has been regarded as a prominent figure in South Korean culture and the Korean Wave . In South Korea, they are credited as the lead female group that shifted the public's focus back to female idols after the Korean music industry experienced an influx of male idol groups from 2002 to 2007. CNN noted the group as a \"national phenomenon\" in South Korea and labelled them the \"Asian version\" of British girl group Spice Girls , and Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9 writing for the Financial Times selected the group as the one of the ten most recognizable features of South Korea, the only musical act to make the list. Japanese magazine Nikkei Business suggested the group's international expansion and success was the musical equivalent to Samsung 's global trend. Their immense popularity in South Korea has earned the group the titles \"The Nation's Singers\" ( \uad6d\ubbfc\uac00\uc218 ; Gukmin gasu ) and \"The Nation's Girl Group\" ( \uad6d\ubbfc\uac78\uadf8\ub8f9 ; gukmin geolgeurup ). Their success has influenced various K-pop girl groups of the new generation, including GFriend , Melody Day , and Apink . A fixture on South Korean power rankings, the group placed within the top ten of Forbes Korea Power Celebrity from 2010 to 2016, topping the list three times (2011, 2012, 2014). Girls' Generation consistently ranked in the top five of Gallup Korea 's \"Artist of the Year\" poll from 2007 to 2016, topping the list three times (2009, 2010, 2011). The Sisa Journal named the group as the most influential entertainers of 2011 and 2012, while Asia Today ( ko ) included the group in their list of 50 Korean Power Leaders in 2011. The group was named one of South Korea's \"super brands\" by the Korean Institute for Industrial Policy Studies in 2011, and one of the five South Korean musical acts that best represented K-pop during the past two decades by the Korea Creative Content Agency in 2015. [note 2] Girls' Generation is also the first Korean celebrity to have official postage stamps distributed by the Korea Post. The group's 2009 single \"Gee\" was declared \"Song of the Decade\" by Melon and regarded as one of the first K-Pop songs to gain international attention, according to Google Statistics. Ian Martin of The Japan Times noted that the group's popularity was still strong even after the Korean Wave appeal had died down in Japan in 2011\u201312. During 2009\u20132011, the group generated \u20a9 68.8 billion ( $ 62 million), raking in $20 million in profits and becoming the highest profit earner for their label SM Entertainment. By 2012, Girls' Generation had sold over 30 million digital singles and 4.4 million albums, making them one of the best-selling artists in South Korea. Their songs have been widely recognized as the signature songs of K-pop: Pitchfork included \"I Got a Boy\" and \"Gee\" in their list of 20 essential K-pop songs, crediting them as the \"magnum opera\" of modern Korean music. Spin labelled \"Run Devil Run\" and \"Gee\" the 11th and 5th greatest K-pop songs, respectively, while WatchMojo.com ranked \"Gee\" second on their list of Top 10 Iconic K-Pop Songs. Billboard placed \"I Got a Boy\" at number 21 on their list of the 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs, describing it as \"proof to why girl-group music is in a league of its own in terms of excitement and boundary pushing.\" Girls' Generation became the first girl group to achieve four music videos with over 100 million views on YouTube in 2015, with \"Gee\", \"I Got a Boy\", \"The Boys\", and \"Mr. Taxi\", and the first Asian girl group to amass five such videos with the addition of \"Oh!\" in 2016. Billboard Boxscore reported that Girls' Generation was the top touring K-pop girl group by 2016. Five of their concert tours ranked among the ten highest-grossing tours by a girl group as of 2016: Love & Peace (2014; $31.6 million), Girls' Generation's Phantasia (2015; $22.3 million), Girls & Peace: 2nd Japan Tour (2013; $21.5 million), The First Japan Arena Tour (2011; $14.98 million), and Girls & Peace World Tour (2013; $14.97 million). The group won two Digital Daesangs (2009 and 2011) and one Disk Daesang (2010) at the Golden Disk Awards , making them the first girl group to win a Grand Prize three times in a row in the award's history and the only girl group to have won a Disk Daesang so far. They also won two Daesangs at the Seoul Music Awards , and were crowned both Artist of the Year and Best Female Group at the 2011 Mnet Asian Music Awards . The Guinness World Records recognized Girls' Generation in its 2018 edition as the artist that earned the most awards at the Melon Music Awards (13 in total). Girls' Generation are regarded as one of the most sought-out advertisers in South Korea. Marketers named the group as the models with the most influence over consumers, attributing the group's positive attention from the public to their vocals, looks, and fashion sense. In 2009, the popularity of \"Gee\" helped the group generate \u20a91.5 billion ($1.2 million) in endorsement revenue. In 2011 and 2012, the members of Girls' Generation combined were the South Korean celebrities who shot the most number of commercials. The group has appeared in over forty endorsement deals\u2014major ones included LG , Intel , Korean chicken chain Goobne Chicken, Casio , Samantha Thavasa , Domino's Pizza and Lotte . They also collaborated with Korean shopping mall 10 Corso Como Seoul to create their own perfume brand \"Girl\". "}

Island made their debut in Japan on June 8, 2008 with the extended play Prologue of F.T. Island: Soyogi . The band started getting recognition in the country following the release of their third Japanese studio album, Five Treasure Island , in 2011, which topped the Oricon Albums Chart and spawned the single \"Flower Rock\". Additionally, F.T. Island is the first foreign male band and the first band in 42 years to top the Oricon Daily Charts. F.T. Island's most well-known songs include \"After Love\", \"Bad Woman\", \"I Hope\", \"Hello Hello\", \" Severely \", \"I Wish\", and the chart-toppers \"Love Sick\", \"Thunder\", \"Until You Come Back\", and \"Love Love Love\".

Island's first album, Cheerful Sensibility , was released on June 7, 2007. Prior to that, the members appeared on the Korean television show \"Wanna be my girlfriend?\" ( Korean : \ub450\uadfc\ub450\uadfc \uc5ec\uce5c\ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 ) on Mnet .

The album combined 13 songs that were loosely divided into two parts, \" Emotional Chapter \" and \" F.T. Island Chapter \", according to the genre of the songs. The \"Emotional Chapter\" consists of rock ballads, while the \"F.T. Island Chapter\" consists of a variety of pop rock sons produced by Japanese composers who worked with the Japanese band SMAP . Selling over 79,000 copies in 2007, it was the sixth best-selling album of the year. The album was later re-packaged on December 3, 2007, titled The Refreshment (Vol. 1.5) with three extra songs, a photo book, a stack of photo cards and a mixing program called Music 2.0, which allows one to adjust the levels of the instruments and vocals. The edition sold 25,724 copies in December 2007. After debuting in Korea, FNC Entertainment (formerly FNC Music ) moved F.T. Island's activities overseas. On March 31, 2008, an autograph session in Malaysia at the Damansara Cineleisure was held, which was to be followed by the group's first concert at the Sunway Lagoon Amphitheater the next day.

After a year of delay, Made was released in December 2016. Two singles were announced for the release: \" Fxxk It \" (Korean: \uc5d0\ub77c \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\ub2e4; Revised Romanization: Era Moreugedda ), and \" Last Dance \". The two songs, along with \" Girlfriend \", took the three top places on the Gaon Digital Chart, selling over one million digital copies combined in five days. The same songs peaked at number 2, 3 and 4 on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, selling 13,000 copies combined. The digital version of Made sold over 1 million digital copies on QQ Music , Kugou , and Kuwo, China's three major music platforms in a day. The album debuted at No. 172 on the United States Billboard 200 with 6,000 equivalent album units, 4,000 of which were in traditional album sales, earning the band their second entry on the chart. They also debuted at no. 1 on the World Albums chart and the Heatseekers Albums chart. In their home country, South Korea, the physical version of the album topped the Gaon Albums chart . Two final concerts were held at Gocheok Sky Dome in January 2017 to wrap up their 10th anniversary tour and Made 's promotional activities. As per South Korea's mandatory military service requirement , T.O.P. enlisted for his two-year service on February 9, 2017 as a conscripted policeman. The remaining members continued promotions without him, holding their fifth annual Japanese dome tour, the Last Dance Tour , in November with 14 concerts in four cities with an attendance of 696,000 fans. The two final shows of the tour were also held at Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul on December 30 and 31. In 2017, YG Entertainment released a reality program starring the group named Run, Big Bang Scout! through YouTube Red , which was the service's first original content to be produced in a country outside of the United States. The first episode of the program was free-released and has gathered over 12.7 million views on YouTube . The following year, the remaining members began their enlistment: G-Dragon on February 27, Taeyang on March 12, and Daesung on March 13, 2018. Seungri was initially announced to enlist on March 25, 2019. The single, \" Flower Road \", was released on March 13, 2018 as a goodbye to their fans. \"Flower Road\" set a record in China, reaching over a million sales in 3 days and 14 hours, the shortest amount of time for a Korean artist. The song also topped Billboard' s World Digital Songs Chart, and the Gaon Digital Chart, where the song recorded the highest digital index of the year thus far. On March 11, 2019, Seungri announced his retirement from the entertainment industry due to scandals surrounding the Burning Sun nightclub , resulting in his departure from Big Bang. On July 6, 2019, T.O.P was the first member to be discharged from the military. He was followed by G-Dragon on October 25, 2019. Taeyang and Daesung were discharged on November 10. On January 3, 2020, it was announced that Big Bang would be performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival , marking their first performance since 2017. Reports also began to surface that the group did not renew their contracts with YG Entertainment. However, YG later released a statement, saying \u201cIt is difficult to confirm or deny any details at the current time.\u201d On March 10, it was confirmed by YG that all 4 members successfully renewed with YG and were preparing for a comeback. Big Bang have been praised for their individuality and ability to fuse a pop sound with rap, R&B and dance elements. The quintet is known for experimentalism and for a \"dominating style of music that surpasses genre boundaries\". During the early days of their career, Big Bang's music was predominantly hip hop and pop rap , although they incorporated R&B songs into their albums as well. A writer for Yahoo! Japan once compared their early materials to that of American hip-hop artists such as The Black Eyed Peas , stating that their songs included \"catchy vocals, [...] rap and characters\". The song \"Ma Girl\", Taeyang's first solo from the group's first album, was described as \"[s]mooth, sexy and bass-heavy\" and reminiscent of Omarion . Similarly, Seungri's first solo from the same album, \"Next Day\" (Korean: \ub2e4\uc74c\ub0a0, Revised Romanization: Daeum Nal ), was stated to have an \"intense '90s Usher vibes\". Their first EP Always (2007) was a musical departure from their previous efforts, with the group experimenting with electronic dance music and setting it as the new music trend in Korea. From their EP Hot Issue (2007), the \" shibuya-kei -influenced\" \"Fool\" (Korean: \ubc14\ubcf4; Revised Romanization: Babo ) contained a \"heavy dance beat paired with a smooth disco coating.\" \" Day by Day \" from Stand Up (2008) was admired for \"weaving in and out of tempos seamlessly and forcing a sense of anxiety on the listener through the beating undercurrent\" and hailed as an \"experiential masterpiece\". They also collaborated with the Korean rock-band No Brain for the rock song \"Oh My Friend\". Alive (2012) was noted for showcasing the group's voice instead of their usual autotune, being described as having \"a mature kind of intensity\", with \" Blue \" being distinguished for including \"more interesting electronic samples and production techniques\" and \" Bad Boy \" described as having a \"nostalgic\" sentiment, being called a \"perfect pop song\" that \"transcends language\". In addition, their song \" Monster \" was praised for its use of mournful tone vocals in an orchestra sound. The group mixed a variety of electronic music with soft rock for their third album Made (2016). which was described as \"career-exemplifying\". \" Loser \" was cited for \"introduc[ing] a more mature style\" to the group \"without losing the images they had enforced through previous releases\", while \" Bang Bang Bang \" was noted for its modern EDM -inspired sound and \" Bae Bae \" for its \"boundary-pushing elements\" and becoming one of the first artist Korean artist to introduce Trap music to K-Pop. In \" Let's Not Fall in Love \", Big Bang was complimented for being at \"their most tender\", with the song being described as having a \"lush production that evokes a range of emotions\". \" Girlfriend \" was a \"mellow hip-hop throwback to the group's early days\". Members of the band have experimented with other genres for solo projects, thus the group has been described as \"rich in variety\" for their fans. Taeyang's EP Hot was mainly a collection of R&B songs, with the singer stating that this genre was his \"main focus\". Daesung's first digital single, \"Look at Me, GwiSoon\" (Korean: \ub0a0 \ubd10, \uadc0\uc21c , Revised Romanization: Nal Bwa Gwisoon ), was a trot song, which drew criticism due to Big Bang's image as \"hip-hop artists\". For his debut album, Heartbreaker , G-Dragon incorporated a mix of dance , hip-hop, and R&B songs. Justin McCurry from The Guardian said that \"[e]ach of the five members has his own individual look, and their musical range is equally eclectic, covering R&B, hip-hop, house, electro and pop.\" Additionally, they have been described as \"artistic superheroes\" for showing \"versatility and success in whatever they do\" by rivaling companies. Their continued experimentation with a diverse range of musical styles and their distinct personalities have been highlighted as some of the main reasons for their popularity and longevity. The Chosun Ilbo explained their \"strong lead among idol groups\" as a result of the quality of their music, noting that \"whenever Big Bang promotes new songs, they want to introduce something new and tell us new stories.\" Internationally, Big Bang is often referred to as a \"K-pop\" group, a label which they do not appreciate, with G-Dragon commenting that, \"We are Korean, so obviously they call our music K-pop. But we never thought of our music as K-pop. Our music is just our music.\" In addition, T.O.P noted that \"[y]ou don't divide pop music by who's doing it. We don't say, for instance, 'white pop' when white people make music.\" The group is known for maintaining tight control over their career, heavily involving themselves since their debut in the production of their music and songwriting, as opposed to many Korean idol groups. G-Dragon is known as the member that is most heavily involved in the production of the group's materials, having a role in producing almost their entire discography spanning ten years, and credited as the main songwriter for the group's earlier hits such as \" Lies \", \" Last Farewell \", and \" Day by Day \". G-Dragon, T.O.P, and Taeyang also collaboratively wrote \"Last Dance\", with G-Dragon co-producing the song. Recurring themes in their lyrics deal with love and relationships. In \"Bingle Bingle\", a protagonist is pleading to his lover to take the next step in the relationship. In contrast, \"Let's Not Fall in Love\" halts a new relationship from growing, depicting the hesitation the risk of opening up to someone. Big Bang have also covered other topics in their songs. \"Fantastic Baby\" and \"Bang Bang Bang\" are often described as club music due to their lyrical contents, with the former described as having an \"anarchistic\" theme and the latter being labeled as the \"party anthem of 2015\". \"Fxxk It\"'s use of vulgarity was seen as evidence to their growing age. Their song \"Loser\" was an attempt to \"humanize the group\" by discussing their flaws. \"Bae Bae\" was noted for its metaphor about sex. \"Sober\" talks about chasing one's dream, while \"Last Dance\" is an ode to the band's time together. G-Dragon's contributions were praised by The Korea Times , who described him as a \"genius singer-songwriter\". The rapper himself describes Big Bang as \"an idol group not born of talent but through effort.\" A writer for Yahoo! Japan complimented the group for their involvement in their work, stating that \"perhaps by contributing to their own materials, not only do they become in sync with one another, but each person's personality stands out.\" Big Bang has received praise for their stage presence and choreographies during live performances. Early in their career, the quintet was choreographed by Seungri and frequent collaborator Shaun Evaristo . While they once relied heavily on street dancing for their moves, they have made a transition towards other styles of choreography. One of the moves from their debut single \"La La La\", involving the group lifting their shirts to expose their abdomens, quickly gained popularity online and became one of the top searches on the internet. The choreography for \"Last Farewell\", in which the group incorporates the idea of \"jump roping\" as a dance move, also gained attention. The dance for \" Bang Bang Bang \", choreographed by Parris Goebel , was one of the most popular dances in 2015. Their stage fashion is also a highlight: Fuse TV noted that \"their outfits are almost as entertaining as their performances.\" The group first adopted the \"hip-hop\" concept for their debut. The release of Always in 2007 was accompanied by a change in image, with the group leaning towards a more preppy - punk style, including skinny jeans with Converse or high-top sneakers, which became a hit trend in South Korea. Taeyang also traded his cornrows for a faux hawk . Members of the group have also consistently altered their hairstyles and color throughout the years. Seen wearing brands such as Bape , 10 deep, Louis Vuitton , Jeremy Scott, and Phenomenon, Big Bang would also wear custom-printed hoodies for many of their performances and music videos. They were also credited for bringing back \"old school\" fashion into the mainstream, popularizing brands such as Nike and Reebok high-top shoes. Described as the \"most fashionable\" one in the group, G-Dragon was known to sport triangular scarves that were later nicknamed \"Big Bang scarves\" during their promotion of the single \"Lies\". T.O.P also gained a following for wearing sunglasses during performances. Their use of props during performances \u2013 including \"an abundance of pyrotechnics, streamers[,] confetti\", LED lights, fog , as well as digitalized \"fire-breathing dragons and a rotor-spinning helicopter\" \u2013 have been well received by critics. In a review of their world tour, The Muse admired the group for playing every song like it's the last, for their precision delivery and their individual strengths. At the peak of popularity for Psy 's \" Gangnam Style \", The New York Times journalist Jon Caramanica noted how Big Bang's concert in New Jersey was the \"true wild heart of K-pop\" as opposed to Psy, highlighting their brightly colored costumes, choreography, and stage performance. In 2012, they ranked number one in the Philippines 's Top 3 Mall of Asia Arena concerts, and their concert in Lima was named the best in South America for the year. When compared to Western artists such as Justin Bieber and One Direction , Big Bang's performance were noted for having their \"edges [...] crisper, the sound louder, the dancing sharper\". They were ranked second on the New York Times list of best concerts in 2012 for their Alive Tour at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey . In March 2012, Krista Mahr, Time magazine's South Asia correspondent, wrote an article about her first K-Pop concert at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul, describing the group as \"K-pop gods\" for their stage presence. Their Made World Tour in 2015 was a critical and commercial success, with the Los Angeles Times calling their Anaheim concert an \"incredibly significant moment for K-Pop\", praising the diversity of their songs and performances, noting how the concert \"escalated the craft of live K-Pop \u2014 which sometimes doesn't live up to the overwhelming enthusiasm of its fans \u2014 into a sleeker and more adventurous kind of arena spectacular.\" Including the group in their list of Best Concerts of the Year for the second time, The New York Times noted how the \"electric, sleek and dizzyingly busy concert by one of South Korea's most vital K-pop acts made even its biggest American counterparts look like rank amateurs.\" Big Bang is YG's most successful artist and was responsible for more than half of YG's albums sold in Korea from 2014 to 2017 before their hiatus due to military enlistment. They were the first Korean mainstream hip hop idols, being credited for the genre spreading throughout Asia as a representative of the Hallyu Wave . The Korea Times have called them \"the icons of Korean pop [music]\", and cited how G-Dragon 's rise to one of the most accomplished songwriters in K-pop \"has inspired many young idol-wannabes to become singer-songwriters.\" Yonhap News Agency stated that the quintet has helped \u201cspread K-pop as a cultural brand spanning the U.S., Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.\" In 2011, BBC declared that \"K-pop bands, including Big Bang, are making their mark around the world\", citing the group's contribution to YG Entertainment's economic growth. After the group won the 2011 MTV Europe Music Award for Best Worldwide Act , Google announced that its subsidiary YouTube would launch its own K-pop channel in recognition of the popularity and success of K-pop. The British daily newspaper The Guardian also published an article discussing the importance of how the win had \"shed light on the rise of Korean music across Europe\". Jacques Peterson from The Sydney Morning Herald credited their success for giving a \u201cidiosyncratic twist\u201d on their genre that breaks the mould of the idol group formula. Suk Park, the president of DramaFever , has hailed them as the vanguard of K-pop. The Michigan Daily have described Big Bang as a rare group that \"both innovates and defines the direction a genre takes\", affirming that the group and its solo acts \"have left a musical imprint that has affected the global music market.\" Mark James Russell, an entertainment journalist based in Seoul, praised the group for defying categorization, stating how \"[o]f all the mainstream acts, they\u2019re doing the most to push boundaries of what is considered K-pop.\" Anna Fifield from The Washington Post claimed that they \"have defined and redefined South Korean pop music. They've defied the idea that so-called K-Pop is inevitably sugarcoated and factory-produced, and that boy bands are all about pretty faces and lip-synching.\" Los Angeles Times praised their constant re-imagination of sound and image, calling Big Bang as \"one of the most inventive, aesthetically visionary acts in its genre.\" In an article published for the quintet's tenth anniversary, Billboard stated that \"no act has enthralled the Korean music world in the past decade quite like Big Bang\" later adding that they have \"shaped the Korean music industry\" and were enabled to \"surpass international boundaries and shirk off the limitations of K-pop's youth-focused industry.\" In recognition of their global popularity, Big Bang is a prominent face of South Korea when it comes to tourism. Their Big Show concerts were promoted by the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism 's Visit Korea Committee from 2010 to 2012, crediting the group's \"big economic impact on the country.\" In 2014, the national postal service of the country, Korea Post , honored them by releasing official postage stamps containning images of the group. In 2016, they were chosen as ambassadors for the country's \"Creative Korea\" tourism campaign. In 2016, Big Bang ranked second on Time magazine's polls for Most Influential People in the World, behind only American politician Bernie Sanders . The same year, Forbes listed the group at number 54 on their annual list of Celebrity 100 , having earned $44 million from June 2015 to June 2016. Becoming the first Korean act to appear on the list, the group had the third highest annual earnings ever for a boy band, behind only One Direction and Backstreet Boys . Big Bang was named one of the most influential artists to impact the Hallyu Wave by The Korea Herald , being among the acts that best represent K-pop, and the \"Top Male Idol Group in the Past 20 Years\" in Dong-a Ilbo 's survey of both the Korean public and music critics. Additionally, they were the highest ranking musicians in JoongAng Ilbo 's \"Most Powerful Figures In Korean Entertainment\" list, placing at number four. In 2017, they became the first Korean artists to be included on Forbes 30 Under 30 list of musicians revolutionizing the modern music industry. Songs released by the group, such as \"Lies\" and \"Fantastic Baby\" are considered some of K-pop's biggests hits and most iconic songs ever. In their list of \"The 21 Greatest K-Pop Songs of All Time\", Spin magazine lists \"Bad Boy\" at number thirteen and the song \" High High \" by the duo GD & TOP at number seven. \"Fantastic Baby\" ranked at number twenty-two in Rolling Stone magazine's \"50 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time\" list. Additionally, \"Fantastic Baby\" placed second and \"Love Song\" thirteenth in Stereogum ' s list of \"Best K-pop Videos\". \"Lies\" was also chosen as the \"Song of the Decade\" by Mnet 's M! Countdown in 2014, and voted as the \"Top Male Idol Song in the Past 20 Years\" in Dong-a Ilbo 's survey of both the Korean public and music experts, that also ranked \"Bae Bae\", \"Fantastic Baby\" and \"Day by Day\" at fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively. \"Fantastic Baby\" was listed on 'The 100 Greatest Music Videos of the 2010s' by Billboard siting the song as one of the K-pop world's most impactful videos of all time. \"Bad Boy\", \"Bae Bae\" and \"Fantastic Baby\" was listed at 8th, 40th and 65th, respectively on 'The 100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s' by billboard, praising the group to be one of the first artist to introduce Trap music to K-Pop. Their work, both as a group and soloists, have influenced numerous artists, including BTS , Jill Scott , Pixie Lott , A*M*E , Nelly Furtado , Cho PD , Got7 , Astro , Teen Top , Monsta X , Chang Kiha , SF9 , Victon , Dynamic Duo , Zion T. , Sonamoo , Topp Dogg , Nu'est , Mamamoo 's Hwasa , Block B 's U-Kwon, iKon , Blackpink , S\u01a1n T\u00f9ng M-TP and Grimes . The Chinese boy band OkBang was specifically fashioned after Big Bang and was stated to have \"many similarities to Big Bang in terms of musical style, wardrobe and hairstyles.\" Filipino singer-actress Glaiza de Castro draws inspirations from Big Bang and their stage presence when performing original Pilipino music and acting. Rapper BewhY , the winner of Show Me the Money 5 , revealed he started rapping after listening to Big Bang, while IU started gaining popularity after covering the quintet. Big Bang's influence extends beyond the music industry, shaping major trends in the fashion industry. Dubbed \"Big Bang fashion\", their style has gained a following throughout Asia, and became a cultural phenomenon in South Korea. The clothes that the members donned on stage are often copied and sold at Dongdaemun Market . In 2011, Big Bang collaborated with Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo to create a line of T-shirts which were quick to become sell-out items. Sun-Times called the members \"five of the most daring, dapper dressers in the world\", and praised their style for always being \"bold, innovative and trend-setting\". Their impact on Korea's fashion industry was highlighted in Vogue Korea 's exhibition in Seoul marking 100 years of the country's fashion history. While the quintet have established themselves as fashion icons, being named one of the most stylish boy bands of all time by western media, they have been criticized for appropriating hip-hop culture, specifically their use of clothes, color coordination, and hairstyles. The quintet is known for their multiple hit songs, with the Gaon Chart reporting that music consumers have learned to trust the group's quality, calling them a \"phenomenon\" because their material is \"consumed evenly by a variety of age groups.\" This allowed them to win several Song of the Year awards from numerous award shows, including in the 13th Korean Music Awards , for \"Bae Bae\" and the 30th Golden Disc Awards for \"Loser\". They were crowned Artist of the Year at the 17th Seoul Music Awards in 2008 and at the 7th Melon Music Awards in 2015. The group was the first artist to win more than one Artist of the Year Award from the Mnet Asian Music Awards , having won in 2008, 2012, and 2015. The group won multiple Best New Artist awards during the early days of their career in Japan . They have won three World Music Awards , including Video of the Year for \"Fantastic Baby\". Big Bang became the first and only Korean act to win an award at the MTV Italian Music Awards when they took home the Best Artist from the World award in 2016. The quintet has been honored with the award for Most Influential Group in Asia at the 5th Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards and with a Special Achievement award at the 58th Japan Record Awards . In 2014, the tenth anniversary of the digital music market release in South Korea, Big Bang was revealed to be the second act with the most digital hit songs in history. With the release of the Made singles in 2015, they became the first. Their albums Hot Issue (2007), Stand Up (2008), Remember (2008), Tonight (2011) and Alive (2012) were also cited as some of the most successful digital albums in history. Their breakthrough hit was the 2007 \"Lies\", which would stay on Melon Chart 's Top 100 for over 54 weeks, the first song to spend over 50 weeks on chart, including 22 weeks in the Top 10. Their follow-up single \"Last Farewell\" tied the all-time record for the most weeks spent at number 1 on Melon , topping the chart for 8 consecutive weeks. In 2011, they reached the top of Cyworld 's Hall of Fame, making them the best selling artist of all time on the chart. Their EP Tonight (2011) became the very first K-pop album to reach the Top 10 on US iTunes chart. In 2015, they became the first act to have three songs in the Top 5 of the Gaon Digital Year End Chart , as well as the first act to hold the first and second spots simultaneously in the same year. They also became the first act to top the Gaon Digital Chart for four consecutive months. Their third album Made (2016), was certified Diamond by the Chinese music service QQ Music and became one of the best-selling albums of all time in China . In 2016, \"Lies\" and \"Day by Day\" were revealed to be, respectively, the second and the fifth most downloaded songs in South Korea since 2006. They also became the first Korean act to have nine music videos with over 100 million YouTube hits under their belt. The music video for \"Fantastic Baby\" became the first by a K-pop group to surpass 300 million views on YouTube. Their first world tour set the record for highest ticket sales in Taiwan , while their London shows gathered the largest crowd for a K-Pop concert held in the UK. Their Japan Dome Tour in 2013 became the highest-grossing tour by a foreign act in Japan. Additionally, their Made World Tour , the most attended tour headlined by a Korean act in history, logged several records for the group: the most viewed online K-pop concert in history, the first foreign act to hold a Japanese dome tour for three consecutive years, the only foreign act to hold three concerts in a row at the Shanghai Arena , the first Korean act to hold a two-day concert in Kuala Lumpur, the largest K-pop arena tour in United States history, the first foreign act to sell out three concerts in Hong Kong on two separate occasions, one of the most expensive concerts in Malaysian history, the largest tour in China by any Korean act, and the biggest K-pop concert staged in Canada.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Eyed_Girls", "name": "Brown Eyed Girls", "labels": ["Nega Network", "Mystic"], "intro": " The Brown Eyed Girls (Hangul: \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc544\uc774\ub4dc \uac78\uc2a4, Japanese: \u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba), often abbreviated as B.E.G. , BG , or \ube0c\uc544\uac78 (beu-ah-geol), is a South Korean girl group with four members: JeA , Miryo , Narsha , and Gain . They debuted as an R&B/Ballad vocal group with \"Come Closer (\ub2e4\uac00\uc640\uc11c)\" in 2006 and have since performed in a variety of music genres. They rose to popularity in 2008 with \"L.O.V.E\" and their retro-dance number \"How Come,\" and cemented their position in the K-pop world in 2009 with \" Abracadabra \", with its electronica-based genre, pioneering (albeit controversial) concept, along with its iconic and now globally recognized dance entitled 'The Arrogant Dance (\uc2dc\uac74\ubc29\ucda4)'\u2014successfully ingraining themselves into modern popular culture. The group started their venture into the Japanese music market with the release of a Japanese version of their massively successful 3rd Korean album, Sound-G , in late 2010, with full promotions being held throughout early 2011 under Sony Music Japan , where they gained moderate success. They returned to Korea in late 2011, to garner further success and critical acclaim with their 4th album and its title track \"Sixth Sense\". Other than promoting as a group, all of the members have released solo albums. The group's leader, Jea, was the one responsible of the group's creation and was actively involved in the selection of the other members, picking out Miryo, who was known as a capable female rapper from the hip-hop community having previously worked with other fellow rappers, such as Gil Seong-joon from Leessang , and the main female rapper in well-known hip-hop group Honey Family. Narsha was chosen when Jea remembered her as a \"talented singer\" from her high school days, and Ga-in was selected by the three members after she was eliminated from \"Battle Shin Hwa.\" According to Ga-in, she was crying in the bathroom after failing the audition, was found by composer Ahn Jung Hoon, and then was chosen through the audition in Brown Eyed Girls' company. Singer Yoari trained with the group until 2006, when it was decided she would be the lead singer for Sprinkler. The four members held several small size concerts, and considered the names \"Crescendo\" or \"Dark Angel\" before officially debuting as \"Brown Eyed Girls\". After more than 3 years of training in singing and holding several small size concerts, the Brown Eyed Girls released their debut album Your Story in South Korea on March 2, 2006, with the ballad track, \"Come Closer\" as their single. Debuting as a \"faceless group\" they did not appear on any visual media and chose to not even appear in their own music video. The album was well received by critics but did not do as well as expected commercially. The album was later re-released to include \"Hold The Line\" (which samples \" Push The Button \" by British girl band Sugababes and \" Technologic \" by Daft Punk ). This song became a hit, further boosting the band's popularity. \"Hold the Line\" was disclosed across the world because it was included in the list of songs from the game Pump it Up. After a short break, the group went back into the studio to work on their second album Leave Ms. Kim ( \ub5a0\ub098\ub77c \ubbf8\uc2a4\uae40 ), which included their R&B title track \"You Got Me Fooled\" ( \ub108\uc5d0\uac8c \uc18d\uc558\ub2e4 ). Subsequent singles were \"Oasis\" ( \uc624\uc544\uc2dc\uc2a4 ) featuring Lee Jae Hoon and \"It's Mine\" ( \ub0b4\uaebc\uc57c ), a collaboration with fellow group SeeYa . During the break between their debut and second albums, the Brown Eyed Girls released their first digital single entitled \"I Am a Summer\" ( \ub0b4\uac00 \uc5ec\ub984\uc774\ub2e4 ), which was later included in their second LP. The first two albums contained typical R&B ballads which had been very popular in the K-pop scene. However, the commercial success was relatively higher in two singles between the first and second albums. Moreover, the second album containing \"You Got Me Fooled\" ( \ub108\uc5d0\uac8c \uc18d\uc558\ub2e4 ) was released at nearly the same time as Wonder Girls' \"Tell Me\" which received a nationwide success in Korea. Therefore, their second album was once again a commercial disappointment. At the same time, the general K-pop scene was changing from R&B ballads to dance music. In January 2008, Brown Eyed Girls came back with their first mini-album \"With L.O.V.E.\" Their single, \"L.O.V.E,\" was a departure from the B.E.G. sound that people had come to know but it became an instant success and Brown Eyed Girls scored their first No. 1 song and also one of the top hit songs in the first half of 2008. \"Love Action\" was the second single taken from the mini album. With Love also marked the group's second digital album (after \"I Am a Summer\"), though it was released in conventional CD format as well. After the release of their first mini-album, they could achieve the commercial success. \"Love\" was composed by Saint-Binary and Min-Soo Lee. Looking to strengthen their success, Brown Eyed Girls returned again in September and released their second mini-album \"My Style.\" Title song \"How Come\" is a retro-style dance song that has become a popular trend. On July 20, 2009, Brown Eyed Girls released their third full-length album, the double-disc Sound G . Even though \"Candy Man\" was the first song unveiled from the album, the first heavily promoted single was \" Abracadabra ,\" which was composed by Ji-nu and Min-Soo Lee. He composed the first part of \"Abracadabra,\" and tried to compose the refrain part. However, he could not think of a good idea to make the refrain part. Therefore, Min-Soo Lee, who worked with BEG previously, helped and composed the refrain part of \"Abracadabra.\" The release of this album also saw a shift in the image of the group, as the members redefined themselves as independent and mature city girls.

Inspired by the rotational concept of Japan's girl group Morning Musume , Lee said that his new group would also experience line-up changes, with new members replacing selected members every year to keep the group constantly young and all-rounded. This concept was then newly introduced to the K-pop market. For a while the group was rumoured to be called O.V.E.R, the acronym for \"Obey the Voice for Each Rhythm.\" [a] However, before the group settled with their current name, the company simply referred to them as juniors , a representation of the members' young ages when they first became SM trainees.

The subgroups were part of SM Entertainment's strategy to not limit Super Junior's activities while certain members focused on their individual careers. This allowed the group members greater freedom to focus on different elements of their careers, and gave the group opportunities to explore different musical styles and showcase different skills. The goal of the subgroup formations was also to show that Super Junior could accommodate and perform different musical genres. This strategy was later challenged by critics, as it has influenced an overwhelming amount of music groups to create official and unofficial subgroups alike.

Following the subgroups Super Junior-K.R.Y. and Super Junior-T, on October 2, 2007, SM Entertainment announced the birth of another Super Junior sub-unit project that would begin activities in China starting 2008. Zhou Mi and SM Entertainment's new Taiwanese-Canadian trainee Henry Lau, who was also featured in the music video of \"Don't Don\", were also members of the subgroup. The announcement brought in a huge wave of dissatisfaction and opposition from some fans of Super Junior after the announcement of two new members. Thousands of fans from Super Junior's official fanclub E.L.F. silently sat in front of the SM building and held signs that supported the group having thirteen members. After more rumors regarding adding another member to the subgroup, the fans decided to gain a legal representation as part of SM Entertainment's stockholders. As of March 20, 2008, Super Junior fans purchased 58,206 shares of SM Entertainment, holding 0.3% of the company's entire stock. The fans released a statement that they will take every opportunity to prevent SM Entertainment from adding new members and to keep Super Junior as only thirteen. A time-slot dispute occurred between SM Entertainment and MBC when SM insisted to have Kangin stay on SBS' Explorers of the Human Body instead of MBC's Sunday Night Dong-An Club (\ub3d9\uc548\ud074\ub7fd) where Kangin has been a regular host. MBC temporarily banned the rest of Super Junior from appearing in any future performances and shows hosted by MBC. Kangin also lost his MC jobs to T.O.P. of Big Bang for the music show, Show! Music Core and also two more variety shows, which both soon canceled after Kangin left due to low ratings. MBC demanded an apology from SM Entertainment in order for Super Junior to appear on shows hosted by the channel again. However, MBC concluded that Super Junior's ban was never official, but just a decision for shows' producers to decide. On December 21, 2009, Han Geng filed for contract termination with S.M. Entertainment, unhappy with contract length and salary. On December 21, 2010, the Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of Han Geng. On September 27, 2011, his departure was made official.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-ara", "name": "T-ara", "labels": ["MBK", "EMI Japan"], "intro": " T-ara ( / t i \u02c8 \u0251\u02d0 r \u0259 / ; Korean : \ud2f0\uc544\ub77c ) is a South Korean girl group , formed in 2009 by MBK Entertainment . T-ara's career is marked by hook-heavy dance-pop music, a result of their close partnership with composer Shinsadong Tiger . A broad array of visual concepts have earned the group a \"chameleon-like\" reputation. [b] The group officially debuted in July 2009 with the single \"Lie\", following line-up changes due to creative differences. Their debut studio album Absolute First Album was released in December 2009 and spawned several hit songs including \" TTL (Time to Love) \", \" Bo Peep Bo Peep \", and \"You Drive Me Crazy\". T-ara gained nationwide recognition after releasing \" Roly-Poly \" in 2011, which went on to become the Gaon chart's best-selling single of the year. At the height of K-pop's popularity in Japan, T-ara signed onto management agency J-Rock for $4.7 million\u2014reportedly the highest figure of any Korean girl group expanding into the territory at the time. Both their debut Japanese single and studio album reached number one on the Oricon weekly charts and were subsequently certified Gold. T-ara's late-2011 Korean release Black Eyes spawned three consecutive number ones: \"Cry Cry\", \"We Were in Love\" and \" Lovey-Dovey \". In 2012, T-ara experienced a dip in popularity as the group faced accusations of internal discord, resulting in Hwayoung 's immediate departure with Areum following a year after. T-ara's later material was released to varying degrees of success before the group began focusing on promotional activities in China, where they attracted attention for their cover of Chopstick Brothers' \" Little Apple \" in 2014. T-ara is regarded as one of the most popular K-pop girl groups in China. T-ara's final release as six members was tentatively scheduled for May 2017, ahead of Soyeon and Boram 's expiring contracts; however, conflicts with their management delayed What's My Name? until June 2017, effectively without their involvement. Qri , Eunjung , Hyomin and Jiyeon had previously extended their terms with MBK Entertainment until December 31, 2017. The original pre-debut five T-ara members (Jiae, Jiwon, Eunjung , Hyomin and Jiyeon ) trained together for three years under Mnet Media . The meaning behind the group's name, which is based on the word \" tiara \", comes from the idea that they will become the \"queens of the music industry\". In April 2009, they released their first song \"Joheun Saram (Ver. 1)\" (\uc88b\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c, \"Good Person\") for the Cinderella Man soundtrack. Jiyeon teamed up with labelmates SeeYa and Davichi for a collaboration single titled \"Yeoseong Shidae\" (\uc5ec\uc131\uc2dc\ub300, \"Women's Generation\"), which was released in May 2009. In June 2009, Mnet Media announced that Jiae and Jiwon would be leaving T-ara due to differences in music style. The first new member to be added to the group was Boram , the daughter of singer Jeon Young-rok and actress Lee Mi-young. Soyeon , a former trainee of SM Entertainment who was supposed to be the leader of Girls' Generation , and Qri were added to T-ara three weeks prior to debut. In early July 2009, the group was moved from Mnet Media to its subsidiary company Core Contents Media. T-ara made their debut on MBC 's Radio Star talk show on July 29, 2009. Their first performance was on Mnet 's M Countdown music show on July 30, where they performed \" Geojitmal \" (\uac70\uc9d3\ub9d0, \"Lies\") and \"Norabollae?\" (\ub180\uc544\ubcfc\ub798?, \"Wanna Play?\") from their debut single. Their debut was looked upon negatively by webpostings, where people stated that it was lipsynched and commented that it seemed like an \"elementary school\" performance. The group announced afterwards that future performances would be live. In September 2009, Eunjung, Soyeon, Hyomin and Jiyeon collaborated with labelmates Kwangsu, Jihyuk, and Geonil of Supernova for the single \" TTL (Time to Love) \". It was released on September 15, 2009, and became both groups' first number one song as it topped many of the online charts. T-ara and Supernova collaborated again for \" TTL Listen 2 \", a sequel to \"TTL (Time to Love)\", which was released on October 9, 2009, and included all the members from both groups. T-ara released their debut studio album, Absolute First Album , on November 27, 2009. In order to determine the album's title track, Core Contents Media held a survey in which the public had to choose between \" Bo Peep Bo Peep \" or \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" (\ucc98\uc74c\ucc98\ub7fc, \"Like the First Time\"). 9,000 people took the survey on various music portals with 53% (4,770 people) choosing \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" over \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\". However, the latter was promoted on music shows instead for unknown reasons. \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" peaked at number four on the Gaon chart, while \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" peaked at number ten. They held their comeback performance on Music Bank on December 4, 2009. At the 24th Golden Disk Awards , T-ara was awarded Rookie of the Year along with girl group 4minute . The group won their first-ever music show award with \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" on the New Year's Day episode of Music Bank . The song went on to win five awards in total: two on Music Bank and three on Inkigayo , earning them a \"Triple Crown\". Later in January 2010, the group announced promotions for their follow up single, \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\", which ended quickly as Soyeon was diagnosed with H1N1 . The same month, T-ara made a cameo appearance on the seventh and eight episodes of God of Study , in which Jiyeon played a main role. In February 2010, the group announced a re-release of their debut album under the title Breaking Heart . The two lead singles, \"Neo Ttaemune Michyeo\" (\ub108 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uccd0; \"I Go Crazy Because of You\") and \"Naega Neomu Apa\" (\ub0b4\uac00 \ub108\ubb34 \uc544\ud30c, \"I'm Really Hurt\"), were digitally released on February 23, 2010, and peaked at number one and number thirty-one on the Gaon chart, respectively.\nT-ara held their comeback performance on the same day on M Countdown , and won several music awards for \"Neo Ttaemune Michyeo\" over the course of their promotions: two consecutive Mutizen wins on Inkigayo and one first place award on M Countdown .

After promotions for \"Neo Ttaemune Michyeo\" ended, T-ara performed \"Naega Neomu Apa\" on music shows until early April 2010. In June 2010, the group donated all the proceeds of the World Cup merchandise sold on their online clothing shop T-ara Dot Com to a charity for African children. On July 16, 2010 T-ARA representatives announced the addition of Hwayoung Ryu as the seventh member of the group. The reason given was that with so many solo projects, they would be able to have a more complete lineup for T-ARA when individual members were filming or doing other appearances. They also stated that it would allow the members to undertake more solo activities, and would give them all some relief from their heavy schedules. In November 2010, the group was in the third season of the reality show Hello Baby , in which they took care of Moon Mason and his two brothers. T-ara released the digital download for \" Wae Ireoni \" (\uc65c \uc774\ub7ec\ub2c8, \"Why Are You Being Like This\"), the lead single for their first extended play, Temptastic , on November 23, 2010. Temptastic was released in digital format on December 1, 2010, along with their second single, \" Yayaya \". The album's physical release was delayed until December 3 due to the bombardment of Yeonpyeong earlier in November 2010. T-ara held their first comeback performance through Music Bank on December 3 and began promotions with their new seventh member, Hwayoung , and new leader, Boram, and received two consecutive wins for \"Wae Ireoni\" and \"Yayaya\" on M Countdown .

The title track, \"Roly-Poly in Copacabana\", is a eurodance remix of \"Roly-Poly\", named after the song \" Copacabana \" which was popularized in the 80's in Jongno disco clubs. The album peaked at number three, while the single peaked at number forty and forty-five on the Gaon and Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 charts. The group began follow up promotions for the remixed single on Music Bank . T-ara released their debut Japanese single \" Bo Peep Bo Peep \" on September 28, which peaked at number one on the Oricon weekly singles chart with over 49.7 thousand copies sold, making them the first non-Japanese girl group to rank at number one for a debut single in Oricon history.

T-ara and Davichi released their Christmastide ballad, \"Uri Saranghaetjanha\" (\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc0ac\ub791\ud588\uc796\uc544, \"We Were in Love\") on December 23, 2011; which was later included on T-ara's Funky Town re-release album. The single reached number one on the Gaon Chart and peaked at number two on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 .

On July 25 and 26, T-ara held a concert in Japan, with Hwayoung only performing one song due to a leg injury. After the concert, one member of T-ara tweeted a general message about determination, and four of the other members agreed with her. Subsequently, Hwayoung and her sister, Hyoyoung, tweeted about a \"bad person,\" which gave Korean netizens the impression that there was a conflict within the group. Netizens retweeted the messages and speculated that Hwayoung was being bullied. When the bullying controversy got out of hand, Core Contents Media abruptly announced Hwayoung's immediate departure on July 30, after being with the group for one year and eight months. CCM's CEO, Kim Kwang-soo, claimed that Hwayoung's contract was terminated because staff members felt her behavior was hurting teamwork, and the bullying controversy was not the reason for her departure. The controversy caused the group to temporarily suspend activities, while the members continued with their individual activities. Both Hwayoung and the other members of T-ara have said that facts about their bullying issue were made-up by netizens, but on the other hand confirmed there was in fact a conflict between Hwayoung and the other members.

On March 5, Hyoseong's lawyer revealed that she had filed a civil lawsuit against TS Entertainment in September 2017 to confirm that her contract with the agency is no longer valid. Hyoseong's lawyer stated \u201cFirst, there are payments that Jun Hyo-seong has not received. TS Entertainment also transferred the management rights conferred by its exclusive contract with the singer to another party without the consent of Jun Hyoseong herself. Not only is this a clear violation of her contract, but it is also a source of instability in her promotions as a singer.\u201d He also stated that it would be unlikely of Hyoseong to remain a member of Secret while under TS Entertainment given the situation and the lack of trust and communication between the agency and Hyoseong, effectively ending the group. Retro is the main musical style of the majority of Secret's singles, although the group has channeled other genres such as pop , dance , R&B , and hip-hop . Secret were originally formed with an intention to be an RnB and Hip-Hop group as seen in their debut single, \" I Want You Back \". As Seoulbeats wrote, \"Originally debuting with an urban RnB concept, the girls of Secret have transformed themselves into the queens of retro ever since their breakthrough hits with \u201cMagic\u201d and \u201cMadonna\u201d. Furthermore, with Wonder Girls recently vacating their long-held affair with retro in favor of a more fresh and futuristic(?) approach, Secret lays claim as the next best group to have established a retro identity.\" Catherine Deen of Yahoo! Philippines said that the group is known \"for its unique ability to take retro music and make it their own.\" While reviewing \"Love is Move\", Park Hyunmin of enewsWorld commented that Secret is \"known for its pop-heavy beats and easy-to-follow dance moves\". Hyunmin further added that \"Secret's main appeal is its retro beat and sexy choreography\". Secret's output, particularly with their work with Kang Ji-won and Kim Ki-bum, makes use of live instruments such as brass , saxophones and drums with the incorporation of synthesizers and electric guitars . While reviewing \" Poison \", Seoulbeats commented that \"the composition [of \"Poison\"] contains a very fitting saxophone hook along with recognizable brass and drum instrumentals that have become the trademark of Secret and their in-house composers, Kang Ji-won and Kim Ki-bum, who have produced all of Secret's retro hits. Secret's secret formula for success lies not only in their determined execution of one particular style, but their consistent development of a concept that suits them very well.\" Seoulbeats concludes that \"Secret has carved out its conceptual niche in the K-pop market by developing a distinct and consistent style, and thus they are now in a position to elevate their success and recognition in the industry. While most other groups undergo drastic changes over time to keep current fans interested and to attract new fans, Secret clearly benefits from the advantages of continuity. What other groups or idols have carved out a stylistic niche over the years?\" Secret is also known for their transitions to cute and the girl-next-door image through songs like \"Shy Boy\" and \"Starlight Moonlight\" from the sexy and powerful image through \"Magic\", \"Madonna\" and \"Poison\" while still retaining retro as the main theme for their sound. Although a commercial success with \"Magic\" and \"Madonna\" peaking at number two and number one respectively on the Gaon Charts, Secret failed to win a first place award on any televised South Korean weekly music shows such as M! Countdown , Music Bank and Inkigayo until \"Shy Boy\". Seoulbeats wrote, \"Secret embarked on an aegyo phase in their following release of \u201cShy Boy\" although with much voiced displeasure from the members. Despite the radical change in their personalities, their style remained consistent in staying with and expanding upon their retro identity. The song became a major success as Secret traded in their sex appeal for a heavy dose of aegyo, resulting in much hardware for their chart-topping song.\" Secret kept its cute imagery with their following single \"Starlight Moonlight\" until the release of \"Love is Move\" and \"Poison\". During their promotions with \"Poison\", Jun Hyoseong commented \"Secret has always been known as a cute group that appeals to the general public. This time, however, we\u2032ve escaped that and showed off our unique charms. Our visuals have also changed for the sexy.\" Jun added, \"We\u2032re actually closer to Shy Boy in real life.\" The group's popularity and success in Korea has led to endorsement deals such as Gueoseu Chicken, Googims mall, Grand Mer(Online Fising Game), Nike, Nene Chicken, Good Day Soju and Parkga among others.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_(South_Korean_band)", "name": "Highlight (band)", "labels": ["Around US", "Cube", "Universal"], "intro": " Highlight ( Korean : \ud558\uc774\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8 ) is a South Korean boy band formerly known as Beast ( Korean : \ube44\uc2a4\ud2b8). The band consists of four members: Yoon Doo-joon , Yang Yo-seob , Lee Gi-kwang , and Son Dong-woon . Original member Jang Hyun-seung officially left the group in April 2016, and Yong Jun-hyung left in March 2019. In late 2016, the group moved labels from Cube Entertainment to Around Us Entertainment and subsequently changed their name to Highlight in 2017. As Beast, the group released three Korean full-length albums , nine Korean mini-albums , two Japanese full-length albums, and numerous singles . The group debuted in 2009 with the mini-album, Beast Is the B2ST . In 2011, they released their first full-length album, Fiction and Fact , and made their Japanese debut with the single, \" Shock\" (Japanese Version) . As Highlight, the group debuted in 2017 with the mini-album, Can You Feel It? . Beast initially received attention for the lack of industry success previously experienced by its members, with media outlets referring to them as \"a group of recycled material.\" However, the group has achieved significant commercial success and critical accolades and is one of the most awarded groups of all time at the Golden Disk Awards , the Seoul Music Awards , and the Melon Music Awards . Prior to their debut, Korean news outlets reported that Cube Entertainment would be releasing a new boy group known as \"B2ST\", an abbreviation for \"Boys to Search for Top\" pronounced as \"Beast\". The name was changed to \"Beast\" before their debut, but the group retains the original stylisation in all their promotional material. In October 2009, Beast held their debut showcase at the MTV GongGae Hall and made their live performance debut on KBS Music Bank with their debut single, \"Bad Girl\". A documentary recording the story of the group's debut titled \"MTV B2ST\" was filmed during this time, showing the members as they filmed their first music video and bonded with each other. Their debut mini-album, Beast is the B2ST featured five songs, including the intro track \"Beast is the B2ST,\" \"Mystery,\" and \"Oasis.\" The song \"Yet\" ( \uc544\uc9c1\uc740 , Ajigeun ) was banned from airplay due to swearing in Jun-hyung's rap. Beast won their first award, Rookie of the Month for December, awarded by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism . In early 2010, Beast promoted their second single, \"Mystery,\" from the mini-album. The members created their own humorous amateur music video for the song, featuring fellow Korean pop singers including members of Girls' Generation and Kara . The mini-album went on to sell 40,000 copies, an unusual feat for a Korean rookie group, with the album's original print run of 20,000 copies selling out in its first month. In January 2010, Beast and their labelmates, girl group 4minute , signed with worldwide album company Universal Music Group for their international promotions and album launches and began their first international promotions in Taiwan with 4minute. The group was awarded the Best Newcomer Award alongside girl groups T-ara and After School at the 19th Seoul Music Awards in February 2010. Beast released their second mini-album Shock of the New Era in March 2010 with the lead single \"Shock.\" The group achieved their first number-one win on Mnet \u2019s M!

Despite never leaving the top 12 during the show's run, and ranking 1st for more weeks than any other contestant, Kaeun placed 14th during the finale of Produce 48 and therefore failed to make it to the final line-up. On October 18, 2018, former member Lizzy revealed that Kaeun is preparing to debut in a new girl group following her success on the show. On May 15, 2019, Lizzy mentioned that After School members gradually went their separate ways.

[note 1] Because of the song's provocative spread leg choreography; music producers demanded that \"Mirror Mirror\" be changed or the group could not perform the song on their shows.

In an interview with Newsen, a Cube Entertainment spokesperson said that the song was \"neither a sexy or charismatic concept, but a cute concept \u2013 a hip hop dance song that goes well with the summer feel.\" Its Korean title \"\ubb3c \uc88b\uc544?\" (romanized: Mul Joha?, lit. \"How's the Water?\"), is a slang phrase that men use to ask if the girls in a club are hot. KBS announced that the lyrics for \"Is It Poppin?\" were unqualified for broadcast because they contained the English word \"ass\". 4Minute planned to remove the word from the video for re-evaluation. Billboard K-Town columnist Jeff Benjamin tweeted whether the Brave Brothers' new thing was to sample old-school-sounding R&B. Benjamin also noted that similarly to \"What's Your Name,\" \"Brave Brothers uses a similar formula for 4minute's new track, but it all feels smoother.\" He explains the track \"uses subdued snares, a twinkling Ellie Goulding \"Lights\"-esque sample and a soft, recurring vocal sample. Despite sounding busy on paper, the song flows nicely together as a sweet little blend of R&B and electro-pop.\" The song peaked at number 9 on the Gaon Digital Chart and number 6 on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 , selling 606,713 digital downloads. In September, 4Minute finished its contract with Universal Music Japan, and shut down the group's Japanese official website as well as its fanclub site, 4Nia Japan.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2NE1", "name": "2NE1", "labels": ["YG", "Avex Group", "Warner Music", "Capitol", "School Boy"], "intro": " 2NE1 ( Korean : \ud22c\uc560\ub2c8\uc6d0 , IPA: [t\u02b0u.\u025b.ni.w\u028cn] ) was a South Korean girl group composed of Bom , CL , Dara , and Minzy , formed by YG Entertainment in 2009. After appearing alongside boy band Big Bang in the song \" Lollipop \", a promotional single for LG Electronics , the group rose to fame with the release of their two eponymous extended plays , 2NE1 (2009) and 2NE1 (2011), and two studio albums, To Anyone (2010) and Crush (2014). All peaked at the number one position on the Gaon Album Chart . They also scored nine number one hits on the Gaon Digital Chart , with \" Try to Follow Me \", \" Go Away \", \" Lonely \", \" I Am the Best \", \"Ugly\", \" I Love You \", \" Falling in Love \", \"Missing You\", and \" Come Back Home \". The quartet simultaneously conducted a similarly successful career in Japan, releasing first a Japanese version of their second EP, Nolza (2011) and following up with the studio albums Collection (2012) and Crush (2014). Following a long-term hiatus, Minzy departed the group in April 2016, while the rest of the group disbanded later that November. Their final single \"Good Bye\" was released on January 21, 2017. At the peak of their career and prior to their split, 2NE1 was considered one of the most successful and popular girl groups in South Korea. Having sold 66.5 million records, they are one of the best selling girl groups of all time . Billboard magazine ranked 2NE1 as one of the best K-pop girl groups of the past decade while The New York Times named 2NE1's performance at the Prudential Center in New Jersey as one of the \"Best Concerts of 2012\". 2NE1 was first mentioned by South Korean press in late 2004. Both Spica 's Bohyung and Fiestar 's Linzy were trainees alongside the 2NE1 members. However, they were eliminated before debut. YG Entertainment formally announced in early 2009 that the group would consist of four members and debut sometime in May of that year. The company stated that the group had trained for four years, and that their debut album would contain songs produced by 1TYM 's leader Teddy Park . The group's name was initially announced as \"21\", however, due to the discovery of a singer with the same name, the group was quickly renamed \"2NE1\". The name, pronounced in Korean to approximate English as \"To Anyone\" or ( US ) \"Twenty One\", combines the phrases \"21st century\" and \"New Evolution\". 2NE1's first extended play 2NE1 (2009) was preceded by two singles. The first one, \" Lollipop \", was recorded with label mate Big Bang and released on March 27, 2009 to promote the LG Cyon phone. Though a music video was filmed, \"Lollipop\" was not promoted due to its product advertisement affiliation, which caused issues with the network chart eligibility. The second single, \" Fire \", written and produced by 1TYM 's Teddy Park , was released that May and contained elements of hip-hop and reggae . Its music video had two versions \u2014 a \"space\" version and a \"street\" version. Within the first 24 hours of release, the videos each received over one million views. Both the song \"Fire\" and the group became popular online search terms. The final single, \" I Don't Care \", was released simultaneously alongside their first eponymous EP in July. Promotional activities quickly followed to demonstrate a softer, more feminine image of the group to contrast the edgier image previously portrayed in \"Fire\". \"I Don't Care\" became the most downloaded song of that month, later winning Song of the Year at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . Although group members recorded and released their own solo materials in August, they performed a reggae version of \"I Don't Care\" on Inkigayo in September. Due to the remix's popularity, it was released to digital outlets on September 3 as their next digital single. Buoyed by the success of their singles, sales of 2NE1 totaled 100,000 copies by the end of the year. 2NE1 later performed at the 6th Asia Song Festival , representing Korea alongside three other groups and later winning the Asian Newcomer's award. In 2010, 2NE1 unexpectedly released \" Try to Follow Me \" in February through various digital outlets without any prior announcement or promotion to support the Samsung 's Corby Folder. The song peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart. That summer, 2NE1 traveled to Los Angeles and London to record English songs for an American debut album with The Black Eyed Peas 's member and music producer will.i.am . The group recorded a total of 10 songs in their initial sessions. The quartet's first full-length album, To Anyone (2010), was released on September 9, and debuted at number 7 on the Billboard World Album Chart. Prior to the release of the album, it had already received 120,000 preorders. Containing a total of 12 tracks, four singles were released: the top five hits \" Clap Your Hands \", \" Can't Nobody \", \" It Hurts (Slow) \" and the chart-topping \" Go Away \". A fifth song \"Don't Stop the Music\" was recorded as a \"special gift for Thai fans\" and was also used in conjunction with the group's Yamaha Fiore endorsement. At the 2010 Mnet Asian Music Awards , 2NE1 took home the most accolades: \"Artist of the Year\", \"Best Music Video\" for \"Can't Nobody\", \"Best Female Group\", and \"Album of the Year\" award. On January 19, 2011, \" Can't Nobody (English Version)\" was released on the Japanese digital retailer Recochoku as a ringtone and ringback tone . The following month, an accompanying music video was made available for download through iTunes Japan. Their Japanese debut single \" Go Away \" was released as a ringtone on March 9, and later used as the theme song for the Japanese television program Mezamashi TV . On March 16, the quartet's first Korean EP 2NE1 was made available in Japan; promotional activities were canceled due to the T\u014dhoku Earthquake and tsunami . 2NE1 debuted at #24 on the Oricon charts , selling 3,860 copies in its first week of release. Initial plans for their official Japanese debut on Music Station were postponed to later that year due to the earthquake, though the quartet did participate in the Naver \"Pray for Japan\" campaign alongside many other Korean celebrities to raise funds for earthquake victims. The group returned to South Korea with their second EP 2NE1 (2011), scoring three number one hits: \" Lonely \", \" I Am the Best \", which also won the \"Song of the Year\" award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards , and \"Ugly\" as well as the top three hit \" Hate You \". The album itself was a major success, topping the Gaon Chart and selling over 108,000 copies. Following the end of promotions in August, 2NE1 held their first sold-out solo concert at the Olympic Hall in the Chamsil Olympic Park on August 26, 27 and 28 in Seoul, South Korea before flying back to Japan. Choosing to re-record their second EP 2NE1 (2011) in Japanese, the album was re-issued as Nolza and released that same year, peaking at number one on the Oricon charts and selling over 48,000 copies. Japanese-language editions of \"I Am the Best\", \"Hate You\", \"Go Away\", and \"Lonely\" were released as singles.

That October, MTV Iggy held a global competition, in which 10 bands from all around the world competed in a voting competition for the title of \"Best New Band\". With their song \"I Am the Best\", 2NE1 was crowned winners of the title on November 10, 2011, making this their first US award. 2NE1 performed at Times Square in December to accept the honor. At the end of 2011, 2NE1 was also nominated for the Japan Record Award for \"Best New Artist\", losing to Japanese girl group Fairies . On March 28, 2012, 2NE1 released their first full-length Japanese album Collection along with their second Japanese single \" Scream \". The album includes Japanese remakes of their Korean songs such as \"Love Is Ouch\", \" Fire \", and \" I Don't Care \", and a cover of Madonna 's 1984 hit song \" Like A Virgin \". Multiple editions of the album were released to include a DVD containing the groups Japanese and Korean music videos, according to Oricon 's music website. The album peaked at #5 on the Oricon Daily Chart and went on to sell over 32,000 copies in Japan. Later that year, 2NE1 and label mate Big Bang were invited to perform for the first time at 2012's Springroove festival in Japan alongside some of the top American and Japanese hip hop artists. The previous year, 2NE1 and the subgroup GD & TOP were invited, but due to the Japan tsunami and earthquake tragedy, the festival was cancelled. 2NE1 also collaborated with Japanese hip-hop group M-Flo for the song \"She's So (Outta Control)\", which was featured on the artist's sixth studio album Square One . It was released as the leading track from the album, two weeks before the album's release on February 29. \"She's So (Outta Control)\" reached number 43 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart. 2NE1 subsequently concluded their Japanese promotions by performing at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Japan , which took place on June 23 at the Makuhari Messe . They also won the \"Best New Artist Video\" award for their song \"I Am the Best\". A non-album single \" I Love You \" was also released in their home country, topping the chart and becoming their sixth number one single. That December, 2NE1 and Big Bang made MTV Style's list of \"Best Band Style of 2012\". The two YG Entertainment groups are the only Asian artists to make the list of 10, which includes One Direction , The Wanted , Backstreet Boys , Spice Girls , Destiny's Child , Fun and No Doubt . On March 14, 2013, 2NE1 released the English-language single \"Take the World On\", which was a collaboration with American singer will.i.am . The song had previously been used in an Intel Ultrabook commercial On March 21, in an interview with Elle , CL confirmed that the group has not yet planned an album for the United States, but wanted to produce more songs in English. A second collaboration with will.i.am brought forth \"Gettin' Dumb\"; this time including his bandmate apl.de.ap . The song was featured on will.i.am's second album #willpower , which was released on April 23. 2NE1's next singles were not tied to any album, with the chart-topping \" Falling in Love \" and \"Missing You\", becoming their seventh and eighth number one singles. A third, \" Do You Love Me \", was a top three hit. In 2014, the quartet appeared on an episode of The Bachelor in January and later, on the finale for America's Next Top Model where the latter show was filmed in South Korea. The following month, 2NE1 released their second studio album Crush (2014). Two singles were released simultaneously: \" Come Back Home \" and \"Happy\". \"Come Back Home\" peaked at number one on the Gaon Singles Chart, becoming their ninth number one hit. Their third single from the album, \" Gotta Be You \" was subsequently released on May 20 along with a music video. Crush sold 5,000 copies in 4 days in America, peaking at #61 on Billboard 200 and setting a new U.S record for \"Highest Charting and Best Selling Kpop Album\", beating other groups such as Girls' Generation and Big Bang. On June 26, they released the Japanese edition of Crush, which charted at #4 on the Oricon Daily Album Chart.

Crush was the only record by an Asian artist to make it to Fuse TV 's \"40 Best Albums of 2014\" and ranked first in Billboard magazine's list of \"Best Kpop Album of 2014\" as well as eleventh for its year-end World Album chart. Following the suspension of Bom's contract due to her 2014 drug scandal , other members began exploring independent ventures, sending the group effectively into hiatus. Dara re-established her acting career by starring in web dramas such as Dr.Ian and We Broke Up , as well as KBS's Missing You . Minzy opened the Millennium Dance Academy. CL embarked a solo career in the United States with the release of \" Hello Bitches \" from her upcoming EP Lifted . The group's only activity in 2015 was a surprise performance at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards in Hong Kong. After CL's performance of her solo singles \"The Baddest Female\" and \"Hello Bitches\", all members reunited to perform \"Fire\" and \"I Am the Best\". The performance is now the most-viewed MAMA performance by a girl-group. It was applauded and as a result, was listed as one of the best performances of 2015 by Fuse . Despite not having made a comeback, 2NE1 nonetheless was the 16th most reblogged K-pop group on Tumblr for 2015. Additionally, both 2NE1 and CL were given a nod by Spotify in their \"Year in Music\" Twitter Campaign for each achieving over one million listeners, and being played a \"staggering\" 165 years worth when combined. They also won China 's 2016 Korea First Brand Grand Prize award for \"Top 10 Most Anticipated K-Stars of 2016\". After a year of hiatus, YG Entertainment confirmed the departure of Minzy in April 2016, stating that the group will continue as a trio. Later that November, however, YG Entertainment announced the disbandment of the group. CL and Dara remained signed as solo artists, while Bom was released from her contract. A last single, \"Goodbye\", was released in January 2017 as a farewell to their fans, inspired by a letter CL initially wrote to Minzy. The song topped the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. In 2NE1's debut EP 2NE1 (2009), the group was noted to have a distinct, mixed style. While \" Lollipop \" was categorized as for pop , debut single \" Fire \" is predominately influenced by hip hop . \" I Don't Care \", however, was intended as a song with a reggae feel. Their comeback album, To Anyone , was marked by a strong shift into electronic music. \" Go Away \", the most successful promotional single from the album, is classified as dance .

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2PM", "name": "2PM", "labels": ["JYP Entertainment", "Sony Music", "Ariola Japan", "United Asia Management"], "intro": " 2PM ( Korean : \ud22c\ud53c\uc5e0 ) is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment . The current members are Jun. K (formerly known as Junsu), Nichkhun , Taecyeon , Wooyoung , Junho and Chansung . Former leader Jaebeom officially left the band in early 2010. The history of 2PM started when Korean musician Park Jin-young formed an eleven-member band known as One Day. Eventually the band was split into 2PM and a similar but independent group known as 2AM . 2PM debuted with the song \"10 Jeom Manjeome 10 Jeom\" ( 10\uc810 \ub9cc\uc810\uc5d0 10\uc810 , lit. \"10 Points Out of 10 Points\"), which showcased their acrobatic dance styles. They achieved their first number 1 single with \"Again & Again\". Both singles featured on their first studio album, 01:59PM , released in 2009. The band went on to release another Korean album, known as Hands Up , in 2011. They made their Japanese debut later that year with Republic of 2PM . After more than a year, the group returned in 2013 with their third studio album Grown . In early September 2014, 2PM returned with their fourth studio album Go Crazy . On 15 June 2015, 2PM made a comeback with their fifth studio album No.5 . After much anticipation 2PM returned on 13 September 2016 with their sixth studio album Gentlemen's Game . Since July 2017, the group has been on an official hiatus. The members of 2PM all auditioned (except Nichkhun , who was scouted) to become part of JYP Entertainment. Some members already had experience in the entertainment industry, including Jun. K , who had won several singing competitions. Ok Taecyeon , Lee Junho and Hwang Chansung had participated in the show SuperStar Survival . Some of the members had previously lived in the U.S., former leader Jaebeom in the Seattle area, Nichkhun in Southern California , while Taecyeon spent seven years in Massachusetts before returning to Korea. Originally, the members of 2PM were part of a larger group known as One Day. A documentary called Hot Blood Men captured the group's training days. In this documentary, former member Jaebeom finished at the top spot and received the most fan votes. It also featured the elimination of three trainees from the group: Lee Swichi, Jeong Jinwoon , and Yoon Doo-joon were all cut. However, Jinwoon replaced Im Daehun upon the latter's withdrawal. By the end of the training process, One Day had been reduced to an eleven-member group. The band was then split into four-member ballad group 2AM and seven-member hip-hop group 2PM. While most Korean boy bands at the time adopted a \"pretty boy\" (Korean: kkonminam ) image, 2PM constructed a tough and macho beast-like image when they made their debut. By emphasizing their masculine images, 2PM created the \"jimseung-dol\" (jimseung means an animal or beast in Korean) phenomenon in 2008. Jaebeom was chosen to serve as the group's leader, as he was the oldest member and also the one where all the members acknowledged as the most talented one. He played key roles in several of the band's early singles and associated music videos. 2PM debuted with their single \" 10 Out of 10 \" ( 10\uc810 \ub9cc\uc810\uc5d0 10\uc810 ) on 4 September 2008. In October 2008, they began to promote \"Only You\", another song from their debut mini album, Hottest Time of the Day . Concurrently, 2PM hosted the third season of Korean variety show Idol Army . In April 2009, the group released their second mini album, 2:00PM Time For Change , which they began promoting that month with the single \"Again and Again\". In May they won their first Mutizen Song award on M!Countdown , followed by two more and a Music Bank award. On 11 June, 2PM began promotions for \"Niga Mipda\" ( \ub2c8\uac00 \ubc09\ub2e4 , lit. I Hate You ) on M!Countdown . In July 2PM achieved first place on the M!Countdown and Music Bank charts for the song \"Niga Mipda\". On 30 July, 2PM won the 'Only One Song' award on M!Countdown . At this time, 2PM also starred in the popular Korean variety show Wild Bunny. Later that year a controversy regarding Jaebeom emerged. On 4 September 2009, articles surfaced on the internet regarding Jaebeom's posts from 2005 on his personal Myspace account, in which he expressed his dislike for Korea while still a trainee for JYP Entertainment . These posts, leaked by a netizen who hacked his Myspace account, were taken out of context and severely misinterpreted by the Korean media. Jaebeom issued an apology regarding this matter. Although some demanded that Jaebeom should be forced out of 2PM, JYP Entertainment CEO Park Jin-young stated on 7 September lent the singer a vote of confidence, suggesting that he would remain in the group. Yet the following day, Jaebeom announced on his official fancafe that he would leave the group and return to the United States for a while to calm the situation. He planned to return to school and improve his understanding of music. At the same time, he apologized to his fellow band members for not being a good leader and older brother for them. He also promised to come back as a better person. Park Jin-young confirmed that 2PM would continue on as a six-member group. Due to the sensitive topic of Jaebeom's departure, 2PM withdrew for several weeks from their appearances on variety shows. Despite the controversy, the group went ahead with release of its first studio album. Known as 01:59PM , the album was released on 10 November 2009. Yet questions about Jaebeom remained. The day after the album's release, Park Jin-young announced that Jaebeom could return to 2PM if he wished to make a comeback, although the singer's return was not imminent. In support of Jaebeom, the six 2PM members decided to equally split their income from their first album with him. The album included tracks voiced by Jaebeom, although his face was excluded from the cover. The group finished re-filming their music video for \" Heartbeat \", the title song, without Jaebeom in October 2009. The group began promotional activities for the album on a variety of music shows, including M.Net O Good Concert , KBS Music Bank , MBC Music Core and SBS Inkigayo in November 2009. A week and a half after the album's release, 2PM performed at and was honored at the M.net Asian Music Awards with awards for Best Male Group and Artist of the Year (the latter being one of the three most prestigious awards at the show). The group paid homage to Jaebeom during their performance of \"Again & Again\". During the performance, a spotlight shone over Jaebeom's usual position in the dance formation, and his vocals played over the speakers without being replaced. In late November 2009, after two weeks of promotional activities for the 1:59PM , 2PM earned their first #1 on a TV music show (KBS Music Bank's \"K-Chart\") since the album's release, with \"Heartbeat\", which went on to take #1 on the K-Chart for three more weeks. In addition, \"Heartbeat\" achieved the \"Mutizen\" song award Triple Crown on SBS Inkigayo by being the #1 song the Inkigayo \"Take 7\" chart for three weeks, the maximum amount of time for which a nominated song is eligible to win. On 30 December 2009, at Korean Broadcasting System (KBS)'s end of the year Music Festival, \"Again & Again\" was recognized as \"Song of the Year\", winning with 57,060 votes. 2PM's second single from 01:59PM was \"Tired of Waiting\". The song was performed live for the first time at the SBS Music Festival in December 2009. 2PM's promotion for the album ended with their SBS Inkigayo performance in January 2010. In February 2010, JYP Entertainment announced that Jaebeom would not return to 2PM, as his contract with the company had been permanently terminated, with the agreement of all 6 members. A combined fan meeting and press conference was held two days later with the six remaining members of 2PM and JYP Entertainment CEO Choi Jungwook in attendance. Various 2PM fansites were shut down immediately after the conference as a protest of Jaebeom's termination. Management announced that although 2PM would move forward with six members, a new leader would not be chosen to replace Jaebeom. In April 2010, the band released Don't Stop Can't Stop , a mini-album consisting of six tracks. The group intended for the release to illustrate a stronger side of themselves than did their previous releases. The group made their television performance comeback on Mnet's music program M! Countdown in April 2010. 2PM served as the opening act for nine Wonder Girls summer shows in the United States in 2010. 2PM also performed at the eighth annual Korea Times Music Festival in Los Angeles, California in May 2010, and at the Dream Concert in Seoul, South Korea in May 2010. In May 2010, 2PM released the song \"What's Your Celebration?\" for the FIFA 2010 World Cup . The song samples K'Naan 's Wavin' Flag . In July 2010, Taecyeon and Wooyoung left their position of MCs at SBS Inkigayo. The next month, Wooyoung also left Winwin to concentrate on 2PM's busy schedule. The 1st concerts took place on 31 July 1 August (in Seoul) & 7, 8 August (in Busan) ( 2AM & Miss A were invited as the guests of the concert). More than 12,000 fans attended 2PM's first concerts in Seoul. 2PM performed all their hit-songs since 2008 plus solo performance from each member. 2PM held two encore concerts in Seoul on 4\u20135 September to celebrate their second anniversary. In October 2010, 2PM released their fourth EP, Still 2:00PM , with the lead single \"I'll Be Back\" staying at number one for two consecutive weeks in the Music Bank . In November 2010, Still 2:00PM debuted unexpectedly on the 13th spot of the Billboard's World Album-Chart though no promotions for the album were made in the United States. 2PM was granted the \"Most Popular Asian Singer\" award at the Mandarin Music Honors 2010 in China. The group attended the event on 18 October at Wukesong Arena; it was the tenth annual MMH. Previously, Rain, Jang Nara, and Shin Seung Hoon have each taken home the \"Year\u2019s Best Korean Singer\" award, but this is the first time a Korean artist has won the \"Most Popular Asian Singer\" award. 2PM performed \"Heartbeat\" and \"I\u2019ll Be Back\". 2PM officially made their Japanese debut in December 2010 with their first live event in Japan at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Gymnasium, a place well known for sumo games. The platinum showcase was called \"2PM 1st Contact in JAPAN\" LIVE. In May 2011, 2PM released their Japanese debut-single, \"Take Off.\" The song was featured as an ending song in the Blue Exorcist anime series. 2PM\u2019s first Japanese concert tour, known as the \"2PM 1st Japan Tour 2011 Take Off,\" began in Sapporo on 6 May and ended a week later in Tokyo. In June 2011, JYP Entertainment released the track list of their upcoming second studio album, which would be known as \"Hands Up.\" The album was released later that month on 20 June 2011. For the first time, the album featured two songs composed by 2PM members: \"HOT\" by Minjun and \"Give it to Me\" by Junho. The promotion period for the album was short; it ended just one month after the album's release. This allowed the band to prepare for their Japanese promotions and for their \"Hands Up Asia Tour.\" The 2PM Show began broadcasting in July 2011 on SBS\u2019s E!TV cable channel and featured all six members. It was the first time 2PM would emcee a program with their name on it. On 30 November 2011, 2PM released their first studio album in Japanese language, Republic of 2PM . It contains all of their Japanese singles released to date (Take Off, I'm Your Man and Ultra Lover) plus the Japanese version of their most recent Korean hit song \"Hands Up\", as well as a new song composed by Minjun for Japanese fans called \"Hanarete Itemo\" (\u96e2\u308c\u3066\u3044\u3066\u3082, Even When We're Apart) and 4 other completely new songs.

Authorities stated after the fire had been handled that the fire was relatively small and had been controlled by the time the fire team arrived, and apparently started when a spark from some fireworks which were being used in the music video landed on a sponge. All the members and staff present at the time were confirmed to be unharmed.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Junior-M", "name": "Super Junior-M", "labels": ["SM Entertainment", "Label SJ", "Avex Taiwan"], "intro": "Super Junior-M (stylized as SJ-M ), an initialism for Super Junior-Mandarin , is a Chinese sub-unit of the South Korean boy band Super Junior . The sub-unit is the first international music group in the Chinese music industry to have members of both Chinese and Korean descent. Formed in 2008 by South Korea's S.M. Entertainment , Super Junior-M became the third and most successful subgroup branched off from the Korean band Super Junior . The sub-unit originally consisted of leader Han Geng , Donghae , Siwon , Ryeowook , Kyuhyun and two additional members appearing exclusively to the subgroup, Zhou Mi and Henry . In December 2009, Han Geng filed a lawsuit against S.M. Entertainment and decided to leave the main group and sub-unit, resulting in the sub-unit's temporary disbandment. After a year-long hiatus, Super Junior-M returned with addition Super Junior members Eunhyuk and Sungmin . They released Super Junior-M's second mini album Perfection in February 2011. After Han Geng's leave, the group considers Sungmin as the new \"leader\", as he is the oldest member of the team. However, S.M. Entertainment has not released any statements about electing a new group leader. On April 30, 2018, Label SJ released a statement announcing Henry's departure from the group, leaving Zhoumi as the only Chinese member. Before the official name of the subgroup was released, they were known by \"Super Junior China\". On April 3, 2008, SM Entertainment announced their official name to be Super Junior-M, with \"M\" representing the word \" Mandarin \". The \"M\" can also represent a list of other aspects, such as the first letter of their debut album Me , and also \" m\u00ed \" ( Chinese : \u8ff7 ), the pinyin for \"charismatic\" and \"fan\", the latter meaning referring to their desire to connect closer with fans. In October 2007, SM Entertainment announced that a new Super Junior subgroup would debut in China in 2008. Super Junior's original member Han Geng , and a new member Henry Lau , who performed the violin solo of Super Junior's \" Don't Don \", were announced to be the first two of seven members representing the subgroup. Some of Super Junior's official fanclub, E.L.F, signed online petitions and held protests to express their dissatisfaction and opposition of adding a fourteenth member to the group, fearing that a new member would mean one of the original lineup would get 'replaced'. Many fans boycotted Super Junior's products and held silent protests in front of SM Entertainment's main building in Seoul , holding signs of the \"Only 13\" slogan. Over one thousand fans appeared in front of the SM Entertainment building on E.L.F's third protest on November 3, 2007. Instead of a silent protest, the fans sang various Super Junior songs and shouted \"thirteen.\" Fans purchased 58,206 stocks of SM Entertainment, holding 0.3% of the company's entire stock. They released a statement through the media, stating that they would obtain all chances to prevent SM Entertainment from adding new members and to keep Super Junior as only thirteen. SM Entertainment later announced that they would not add the new subgroup members to the main group. From April 4 to April 7, 2008 the seven members of Super Junior-M were individually announced to the Chinese media in a chain of short trailer clips. The first member, Han Geng, was announced to be the subgroup leader on April 4. On April 5, Siwon and Donghae were revealed to be the second and third members. On April 6, Kyuhyun was announced to be the fourth Super Junior-M member, following the new member, Henry, as the fifth. Ryeowook and another new member, Zhou Mi , were announced to be the final two members on April 7. A trailer of all seven members was released on the group's debut day, April 8. Super Junior-M's trailer clips exceeded 1.4\u00a0million views in less than four days. Super Junior-M debuted in Beijing on April 8, 2008 at the 8th Annual Music Chart Awards, simultaneously with the release of their first music video, \" U \" on Sohu.com . \" U \" is a translated Chinese cover of the 2006 song \" U \", originally by Super Junior . They released their debut album Me in selected provinces of China starting April 23, 2008. A Korean version of the album with three bonus Korean-language tracks was released in South Korea on April 30, 2008. A modified version of the album was released in Hong Kong , Singapore , and Taiwan on May 2, 2008. Though a majority of the tracks in the album were Mandarin remakes of Super Junior's previous Korean hits, reviews were generally positive. Hong Kong Cantopop singer, Hins Cheung , critiqued the album favorably, saying that the album contains \"international-level music\" and that the group is \"vocally-talented\". A month after their debut, Super Junior-M won their first award, Asia's Most Popular New Group, at the 5th annual Music King Awards in Macau on May 25. They took home another three awards that year. On December 27 and 28, Super Junior-M held their first concert, the Super Junior-M Show, in Hong Kong .

They appeared in an episode of the second season of TVB and HunanTV 's collaboration show, Strictly Come Dancing , which made the show's ratings increase to 5.01%, ranking it the third most watched show ever in all of China. Super Junior-M's appearance in the talk show Behind Story ( Chinese : \u80cc\u5f8c\u7684\u6545\u4e8b ) also increased ratings. The show had the highest ratings during their time slot, with a strong 4.05%. Separated into several weekly episodes, the group's appearance in their first episode on the challenging game show Bravely Going Forward ( Chinese : \u52c7\u5f80\u76f4\u524d ) in early August gave the show the highest ratings during that time slot as well. In August 2008, Han was cast in the idol television drama Stage of Youth , a mini-drama dedicated to the 2008 Beijing Olympics . Han portrayed Xia Lei, a youth who aspires to be a famous dancer.

Their style has created a fashion trend amongst students which the media dubbed the \"Shinee Trend\". The group's \"boyish charm\" was an important factor in Shinee gaining fans. With the release of 2009, Year of Us , Shinee's style became more mature, though still maintaining Shinee's unique image. Furthermore, instead of working with famous artists and photographers, SM Entertainment's Visual and Art Directing department usually works with up-and-coming talents with new ideas for Shinee's concepts. When Shinee debuted in 2008 with \"Replay\", it was not only their music which gained attention but also their colorful style\u2014but even four years later, in 2012, Shinee maintained their colorful concept for Sherlock . Their designer, Ha Sang-beg, stated in an interview with the Korean Times: \"Much has evolved over the years, since I change their styles to reflect their music. The feel from their debut single still exists, mixing the overground [ sic ] with the underground, haute couture with street fashion ... but it is very modern, like Shinee.\" Shinee are acknowledged for their innovative approach to music and peerless choreography and are considered as one of the best live vocalists and dancers in Korean pop , known for their good vocal performances and complex choreographies as well as a unique kind of music that is quite different from usual K-pop. At SM Entertainment 's showcase in New York in October 2011, Jon Caramanica of the New York Times summarized them as \"the most ambitious\" of the evening and also complimented the group's strong vocal performance. Furthermore, he stated: \"Their music, especially Replay , Ring Ding Dong and Juliette , felt the riskiest, even if it only slightly tweaked that polyglot Pop formula\". Kim Joo-hyun of Beff Report considers Shinee's greatest strength the dismantling of the boundaries between the role of main vocal and subvocal. He positively emphasised the harmony between the two main vocals, Onew and Jonghyun, saying they sing with an aesthetic of \"contrast\", meaning they can't be separated from each other; on the contrary, they actually suit each other when brought together. He also praised the vocal development of Taemin, the youngest member in the group. Jakob Dorof of the monthly British style magazine Dazed described Shinee with the words \"technicolor visuals\", \"choreography as coordinated as ballet\", and \"wildly adventurous hit songs\", stating they are a group that embodies the harmony of these qualities better than anyone else. Tamar Herman of Paste Magazine described Shinee as one of K-pop's most popular dance groups, \"with cutting edge dance moves that are just as technically creative as the songs they've performed\". Shinee have worked with top choreographers such as Rino Nakasone , who choreographed Shinee's early songs like \"Replay\" and \"Love Like Oxygen\" in 2008, \"Juliette\" in 2009, and the group's hit single \"Lucifer\" in 2010, which was nominated for the Best Dance Performance at the Mnet Asian Music Awards in 2010. Misha Gabriel choreographed the songs \"Amigo\" (2008) and \"Ring Ding Dong\" (2009). Tony Testa worked on Shinee's later hit songs like \"Sherlock\" (2012) and \"Dream Girl\" (2013), which are characterized by a unique and distinctive style, while Ian Eastwood worked on \"View\" (2015) \u2013 breaking away from the group's usual powerful and precise choreography and working instead with a groove style that showcases the teamwork of the group. All three songs were awarded with the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards : in 2012, 2013, and 2015. The predominant musical genre of the group is contemporary R&B . The group's early hits like \"Replay\" and \"Lucifer\" veered toward R&B and dance pop, while singles such as \"Get Down\" and \"Jo Jo\" explored other musical styles such as hip-hop and dance. Shinee's third album is significantly influenced by funk rock , electronic music and rock. Billboard columnist Jeff Benjamin compared Shinee's songs like \"Punch Drunk Love\" and \"Aside\" to the sounds of Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie , while tracks like \"Beautiful\" and \"Runaway\" combine \"unique electronic production elements over sugary boy band harmonies to create year-round pop music\". Shinee as a group is known for their experimental sound and various genres with every new release like the group's fifth extended play, Everybody , whose title song is classified under the complextro genre. Jakob Dorof of Tiny Mix Tapes stated that \" Everybody is proof positive that, even in a culture industry designed to minimize the role of real musicianship, talent will find its way to the top.\" He also remarked that \" Close the Door \" highlights the experimental and versatile nature of Shinee's music which frequently charts into unfamiliar territories. With the release of their fourth Korean album, Odd , Shinee returned to their old sound while experimenting with new genres like deep house . The album featured songs in an array of styles including the two singles the electro-house \"View\" and Rocky Horror-inspired funk track \"Married to the Music.\" Alexis Hodoyan-Gastelum of MTV IGGY praised the title song, \"View\", describing it as a great, laid back summer jam even though \"the song fools us into thinking it's an uptempo ballad before reaching its techno peak at the chorus.\" Jeff Benjamin on the other hand praised \"Odd Eye\", which is written and composed by member Jonghyun. Benjamin states the group's \"return to the R&B side of Shinee with feathery vocals, tight harmonies and member Onew's falsetto howls acting a centerpiece to this grooving opener\" but he also adds, \"despite initially debuting with a R&B sound, Shinee is arguably most exciting when experimenting\". Early in their career, Shinee were endorsers for several brands, such as the cosmetic brand Nana's B and the sports brand Reebok . Later, they endorsed the clothing brand Maypole as well as the popular Korean cosmetic brands Etude House and The Saem. In 2012, Etude House's Lash Pump 3-Step Volume-Cara, a PC-based and mobile micro-site featuring \"doll eyelashes\" main model Sandara Park and Shinee\u2014appearing as puppets\u2014was awarded first place for the Movile Marketing and Product Promotions category at the 9th Web Award Korea . The group was also part of the popular Korean comic The Blade of the Phantom Master and then-new webtoon series ENT . Furthermore, the group endorsed the sports brand Skechers and collaborated with Naver and Skechers for T-shirts and caps designed by the group members. Overall, Shinee are models with influence over consumers, as products featuring the Shinee label can increase the revenue of companies \u2013 \"Shinee's Sparking Water\", a simple carbonated bottled water, which is sold by e-mart , the supermarket chain business of Shinsegae , boasted a combined sales of 67 million won over a one-month period.

Members of Super Junior-T explained that they wanted to change their idol appearance and hope that they would gain different fans from their new trot image.\n"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS501", "name": "SS501", "labels": ["CI", "DSP", "Pony Canyon (Japan)", "Warner Taiwan"], "intro": " SS501 is a South Korean boy band consisting of five members: Kim Hyun-joong , Heo Young-saeng , Kim Kyu-jong , Park Jung-min and Kim Hyung-jun . They debuted in 2005 with the EP Warning , which included their first number one song, \"Never Again\". [ citation needed ] In 2007, SS501 entered the Japanese market with the maxi single Kokoro , which debuted at number five on the Oricon chart . The following year, in 2008, they became the first South Korean artists to win the award for Best New Artist at the Japan Gold Disc Awards . SS501 has released one studio album and seven EPs in Korean, and two studio albums and three EPs in Japanese. The group has been inactive since 2010, however the sub-group Double S 301 , composed of members Heo Young-saeng, Kim Kyu-jong and Kim Hyung-jun, continues to release music. The name of the band is a combination of letters and numbers that have special meaning. The first \u201cS\u201d stands for \"superstar\", the second \u201cS\u201d is an abbreviation for \"singer\", and the combination of 5, 0, and 1 symbolizes \"five members united as one forever\". Before debuting with SS501, most members had experiences in the entertainment world. Kim Hyun-joong was initially about to debut in a five-member group, of which Han Yeon of B2Y (now disbanded) was to be the leader and Kim the youngest member. During 2001 and 2002, while working as a waiter in a family restaurant located at Jamsil-dong , Kim was introduced to a new set up management company CEO. While the group underwent training together, they were asked by their company to debut in China as a Hallyu project group, but they rejected the offer and disbanded. Heo Young-saeng started as a trainee at SM Entertainment for about 2.5 years. He then joined DSP Media , formerly known as DSP Entertainment and trained for three months before debuting as a member of SS501. In relation to SM Entertainment as a trainee, according to his father if he had stayed with SM Entertainment most probably he would have debuted together with Super Junior . Park Jung-min was once a commercial model for condoms. When he was 13, he was scouted by an agency and was accepted by both DSP Media and S.M. Entertainment . At that time, SM Entertainment told him that they were preparing a new group, but that the group consisted of many members, which according to Park was probably Super Junior since he saw them rehearsing too. [ citation needed ] Kim Hyung-jun appeared on Ock Joo-hyun 's music video, \"Catch\" in 2004. He was also the first one to be included in SS501, which means he had the longest training period. In addition, SS501 has had their first variety show before they officially debuted entitled SS501 M!Pick by MNET , documenting their pre-debut days and three months after their debut. SS501 debuted on June 8, 2005 along with their first EP, Kyeonggo ( Korean : \"\uacbd\uace0\" , \" Warning \");. Their second mini album, Snow Prince was released in late 2005, five months after their debut. The group earned popularity right away as they won many rookie awards after their debut. The group was inactive in Korea for most of 2006, although they had their first fan meeting in Japan in April of that year. The reason was due to Heo Young Saeng's throat condition, which required a surgery, thus resulting in a need for time to fully recover. In mid-2006, they held their first successful concert, \"Step Up Concert\" in Osaka , Japan. In late 2006, they returned to Korea in order to promote their first studio album, which was released on November 10 entitled S.T 01 Now . Singles from the album included \"Unlock\" and \"Four Chance\". Alongside promoting the album on various variety and music shows, they also filmed a show on MNet, which was called SS501 SOS . The group (excepting Heo Young Saeng, who was recovering from the surgery) also lent their voices for the 2006 animated movie Pi's Story . Later in 2007, the group debuted in the Japanese market to further spread their activities and challenge themselves outside Korea. The group at this time released their Japanese single Kokoro , alongside multiple versions, including one with all members and five featuring each member individually. The single debuted at the 5th spot on the Oricon chart, and moved to 3rd spot the next day. It was also chosen as an ending theme song for an anime entitled Blue Dragon . SS501 appeared in the Japanese drama Hotelier as a cameo seen in episode seven. Later in September, SS501 released their second single in Japan entitled Distance . Finally in October 24, a month later, a full album was released with their self-titled album, SS501 . SS501 also received the \"Newcomer Award\" by Japan Gold Disc Award in January 2008; this was the first time for Korean artists to receive this award. SS501 returned to Korea with their single Deja Vu , which was released on March 13, 2008. The title track was the first song to be promoted, and they began their comeback on music channel M.Net's M Countdown . After their success with their single \"Deja Vu\", they began to promote their second single, \"A Song Calling for You\". They performed their Goodbye Stage on Music Bank in June 2008, to return to Japanese activities. Their third Japanese single was released on June 18, 2008 entitled Lucky Days .

While both Kim and Park were busy with their schedules, the remaining three members formed 'SS501 Project Group' with Heo Young-saeng as the leader. The 'Project Group' was initially to be named after their fan club 'Triple S', however before the sub-unit group debut it was decided to retain 'SS501' name out of respect to the absent members. They released a project album named U R Man in November 2008, with a high tempo dance track \"U R Man\", which the three remaining SS501 members promoted by themselves, with the exception of some special performances that included all five band members.

(2006) and Mirotic (2008), both winning the Golden Disk Award for Album of the Year . The latter album also contains the pop hit \" Mirotic \", touted by international music critics as a staple song of K-pop . With four chart-topping singles, TVXQ gained widespread media attention in Japan following the release of their fourth Japanese album The Secret Code (2009). However, despite their commercial success, the group plunged into legal turmoil and internal conflict when members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu attempted to split from their Korean agency S.M. Entertainment. Prior to the trio's departure in 2010, TVXQ released their last Japanese album as a quintet, Best Selection 2010 , which became the group's first album to top the Oricon Albums Chart . The album spawned two platinum-selling singles, including the long-running hit \" Share the World \". After a year-long hiatus, TVXQ returned as a duo with remaining members Yunho and Changmin. They released TVXQ's fifth Korean album Keep Your Head Down (2011), topping album charts in most major Asian markets upon release. Their first two Japanese albums as a duo, Tone (2011) and Time (2013), solidified their success in Japan as it forged TVXQ's reputation as one of the top-touring artists in the country. Their eighth Japanese album With (2014) made TVXQ the first and only foreign music act in Japan to have four number-one albums in a row. Selling over 10 million physical records in the first 10 years of their career, TVXQ have become one of Asia's most successful music acts of their generation. They are often referred to as \"Asia's Stars\" and the \"Kings of K-pop\" for their immense success and contributions to the Hallyu . According to the Oricon , TVXQ have the most number-one singles and albums for a foreign artist in Japan, and are also Japan's best-selling foreign artist in CD singles of all time. Their Time Tour , one of the highest-grossing concert tours of 2013, broke attendance records for foreign singers in Japan until 2017, when TVXQ broke that same record with their Begin Again Tour . TVXQ are the first non-Japanese Asian artists to headline a nationwide five-Dome tour and the first foreign artists to headline the Nissan Stadium . Billboard has described the group as \"K-pop royalty\". With the disbandment of H.O.T. in 2001 and Shinhwa 's departure in 2003, producer Lee Soo-man of S.M. Entertainment had to search for another boy band to compete against other popular idol groups in the growing K-pop market. In early 2003, Lee eventually selected five teenage boys from four different S.M. training teams to debut in a vocal dance unit. Xiah Junsu, the first to join the new group, became an S.M. trainee at age eleven and was originally trained to be a solo singer. He was put into an R&B trio with trainees Sungmin and Eunhyuk (both now of Super Junior fame), and the trio made their first appearance on the reality show Survival Audition \u2013 Heejun vs. Kangta, Battle of the Century , a 2002 series that starred former H.O.T. members Kangta and Moon Hee-jun as mentors for prospective singers. U-Know Yunho, who signed with S.M. Entertainment in 2000, was a member of several failed project groups throughout his years as a trainee. In 2001, he was featured as a rapper in Dana 's debut single \"Diamond\" and briefly toured with her. That same year, Hero Jaejoong auditioned for S.M. Entertainment and was subsequently accepted into the agency after going through various auditions. Following trainees Heechul and Kangin , Yunho and Jaejoong joined the project group Four Seasons in 2002, but the quartet disbanded when Yunho and Jaejoong were selected to join Lee's new group in 2003. Heechul and Kangin went on to debut as members of Super Junior two years later. Max Changmin, the youngest at age fifteen, was the fourth to join the new band. Micky Yoochun, who started his training only a few months before the group's official debut in December 2003, was the last member to make the cut. The boys received phone calls from Lee and were told to attend a photo shoot session, which turned out to be a briefing for their upcoming debut. To build group chemistry, the members moved into a small dormitory room arranged by their management. After a few weeks of training and rehearsals, they recorded their first song \"Thanks To\" and performed it at the S.M. New Face Showcase. Yunho was appointed as the group's leader. During their early recording sessions, the group was offered some tentative names to use: SM5, Dream Team, O Jang Yuk Bu ( Korean : \uc624\uc7a5\uc721\ubd80 ; Hanja : \u4e94\u81df\u516d\u8151 ; literally \"The Five Visceras and the Six Entrails\"), Jeon Meok Go (short for Jeonseoleul Meokgo Saneun Gorae; \uc804\uc124\uc744 \uba39\uace0 \uc0ac\ub294 \uace0\ub798 ; literally \"A Whale That Eats Legends\"), and Dong Bang Bul Pae ( \ub3d9\ubc29\ubd88\ud328 ; \u6771\u65b9\u4e0d\u6557 ), the Korean name for the Chinese wuxia character, Invincible East . They decided on Dong Bang Bul Pae, and even obtained permission to use the name from Film Workshop , but the name was later rejected by their management because the Hanja was not aesthetically pleasing. Their name was subsequently finalized to Dong Bang Shin Ki ( \ub3d9\ubc29\uc2e0\uae30 ; \u6771\u65b9\u795e\u8d77 ), which was suggested by Lee's acquaintance. TVXQ made their first public appearance and debut on December 26, 2003 in a BoA and Britney Spears showcase, where they performed their debut single \" Hug \" and an a cappella rendition of \" O Holy Night \" with BoA. The group released the physical single of \"Hug\" on January 14, 2004. The single debuted at number thirty seven on the monthly MIAK chart [fn 1] selling less than 5,000 copies. On February 6, 2004 TVXQ made their official television debut at the Mnet and KM cable music program Music Tank , where they performed \"Hug\" and \"O Holy Night\". The following day, they performed on SBS 's Inkigayo . The sales of \"Hug\" picked up following their television appearances, and on March 28, 2004, TVXQ won their first music show award with \"Hug\" on The Music Trend ( Inkigayo ). \"Hug\" won two more awards in April 2004. By May 2004, \"Hug\" sold 118,114 copies and reached a peak at number four on the MIAK. \"Hug\" stayed charted for ten consecutive month\nOn June 24, 2004, TVXQ released their second single \"The Way U Are\", which entered the MIAK at number two. In July 2004, TVXQ participated in their first SM Town project and collaborated with other label mates to release the SM Town album, 2004 Summer Vacation in SMTown.com . In October 2004, TVXQ released their first full-length studio album Tri-Angle . It was TVXQ's first record to debut at number one, selling a total of 242,580 copies in the first month. According to the MIAK, \"The Way U Are\" and Tri-Angle became two of the top ten best-selling albums of 2004. During the promotions of Tri-Angle , S.M. Entertainment had plans to promote TVXQ in mainland China and Taiwan under the support of its overseas partner, Avex Group . TVXQ members recorded Mandarin versions of their popular singles and released them exclusively on the Taiwan presses of Tri-Angle . Inspired by the success of BoA's Japanese music career, TVXQ signed with Japan's Avex Group in late 2004. In November 2004, they released an English version of \"Hug\" in Japan, but the single failed to gain momentum despite TVXQ's Hallyu success. Re-introduced as Tohoshinki ( \u6771\u65b9\u795e\u8d77 ) for the Japanese market, the members learned Japanese and move to Japan for their first official single. They released their debut Japanese single \" Stay with Me Tonight \" in April 2005 through Avex's record label Rhythm Zone . The single reached to number thirty-seven on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart . Before returning to Korea to prepare for their second Korean album Rising Sun , TVXQ released their second Japanese single \"Somebody to Love\" in July 2005, which peaked at number fourteen. TVXQ's debut in Japan was not as successful as their management had hoped, and the group said their first few months in Japan were \"difficult.\" In August 2005, TVXQ performed for Avex's annual A-Nation summer concert tour, their first musical festival in Japan. Rising Sun was released in South Korea on September 12, 2005 and became the group's first breakthrough album. It debuted at number one on the Korean charts and was the fourth best-selling record of 2005. The album's lead single \"Rising Sun\" was a popular hit, and it eventually became the group's signature piece . TVXQ ended the year with two more releases: their third Japanese single \"My Destiny\" and a Korean maxi single \" Show Me Your Love \", featuring Super Junior. The latter single entered the Korean charts at number one. Rising Sun garnered several popularity awards for the group at the end of the year, including M.net KM Music Video Festival 's Best Popular Music Video award, the ceremony's daesang (\"grand prize\"). In February 2006, TVXQ embarked on their first headlining international concert tour, the Rising Sun Tour . Comprising 6 shows only, the tour started off with four shows in Seoul, South Korea. On July 14, 2006, the tour stopped by Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , where TVXQ were the first Korean artist to hold a concert in the country. The tour's second and last overseas stop was in Bangkok , Thailand on July 15, 2006. A CD recording of their concert in Korea was released on July 14; the DVD was released six months later in January 2007, and had initial sales of 38,000 units. On March 8, 2006, TVXQ released their fourth Japanese single, \"Asu wa Kuru Kara\" ( \u660e\u65e5\u306f\u6765\u308b\u304b\u3089 ) , which became the seventeenth ending theme for the long-running anime series One Piece . Their debut Japanese album Heart, Mind and Soul was released two weeks later, and it debuted on the Oricon Albums Chart at number twenty-five, selling 18,000 copies. In April 2006, TVXQ released their first double A-side single \"Rising Sun / Heart, Mind and Soul\" as a follow-up from their album. The single peaked at number twenty-two. To support Heart, Mind and Soul and its subsequent releases, TVXQ held their first Japanese tour, the 1st Live Tour 2006: Heart, Mind and Soul, from May to June 2006. The tour consisted of eleven shows that attracted an audience of 14,800. After the tour, TVXQ released two more Japanese singles, \"Begin\" and \"Sky\". The latter debuted at number six on the Oricon, making it the group's first single to reach the top ten in Japan. The group resumed their Korean activities with the release of their third Korean album, \"O\"-Jung.Ban.Hap. on September 29, 2006. The album entered the Korean charts at number one and became the best-selling record of 2006 after one month of release. The success of the album gave TVXQ four coveted grand prize awards in 2006: at the M.net KM Music Festival, they received four awards, including Artist of the Year and Best Group. TVXQ won all three of their nominations at the 16th Seoul Music Awards , and at the 21st Golden Disk Awards , \"O\"-Jung.Ban.Hap won Album of the Year, the ceremony's grand prize. TVXQ also took home the biggest awards at the SBS Gayo Daejeon . The album's international success won the group their first award in Japan, the Bess Buzz Asia in Korea award at the MTV Video Music Awards Japan . In November 2006, TVXQ returned to Japan to release their eighth Japanese single, \"Miss You / 'O'-Sei-Han-G\u014d\" ( miss you / 'O'\u2010\u6b63\u30fb\u53cd\u30fb\u5408 ) , which became TVXQ's first top three single on the Orico'. In January 2007, TVXQ announced their second international tour, the 2nd Asia Tour: O , and toured Seoul, Taipei , Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai and Beijing . The tour attracted an audience of 390,000. TVXQ released their second Japanese album Five in the Black in March 2007, debuting at number ten on the Oricon with nearly 27,000 copies sold on its first week. Drawing in an audience of 46,600, the group toured Japan from May to June 2007. The five singles TVXQ released upon completion of the tour, including \" Lovin' You \", \" Summer \", \" Shine / Ride On \", \" Forever Love \" and \" Together \", peaked in the Oricon top five, their most successful being \"Summer\", which peaked at number two. TVXQ were also featured in Kumi Koda 's thirty-eighth single \" Last Angel \", which was used as the theme song for the Japanese release of Resident Evil: Extinction . Released in November 2007, the single peaked at number three on the Oricon and won Best Collaboration Video at Japan's MTV Video Music Awards . TVXQ's sixteenth Japanese single \" Purple Line \", released on January 15, 2008, became the group's first single to debut at number one on the Oricon. Their third Japanese album T was released a week later and debuted at number four, selling over 52,000 copies. With the critical and commercial success of T , TVXQ delayed their Korean comeback to put more focus on their new Japanese releases, and from February to March 2008, the group released a series of five singles consecutively for six weeks, promoting the releases as the \"Trick\" project. Each single contained a solo track by a member, as well as some of their own compositions. With their new records the group toured around Japan from March to May 2008. The T tour concluded with 17 shows and attracted an audience of 150,000 people, more than three times the size of their previous Five in the Black tour. The tour's DVD, released in August 2008, sold 112,000 copies. T also received a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) in May 2008. Shortly before completing the T tour, TVXQ released their twenty-second Japanese single, \" Beautiful You / Sennen Koi Uta \". The latter track, \"Sennen Koi Uta\", was used as the opening theme for the historical Korean drama The Legend when it aired in Japan. Despite the drama's disappointing ratings, the single was a number-one seller, making TVXQ the first non-Japanese Asian performer to release two number-one singles in Japan, a record which was last held by Taiwanese artist Ou-yang Fei-fei twenty-four years prior. In July 2008, TVXQ released their twenty-third single, \" D\u014dshite Kimi o Suki ni Natte Shimattandar\u014d? \", their third number-one single in Japan. They performed the single at Avex's 20th anniversary meeting and at A-Nation 2008, their fourth consecutive concert with Avex. In August 2008, TVXQ returned to Korea to prepare for the release of their fourth Korean album, Mirotic . The group assumed more creative control in this album compared to their last Korean releases: Yunho wrote the rap for several tracks, Junsu and Changmin wrote the lyrics to two tracks and Jaejoong and Yoochun recorded their own solo tracks. Mirotic was slated to be released on September 24, 2008, but due to an unprecedented amount of pre-orders , the release was postponed to September 26. The album entered the charts at number one and sold over 110,000 copies in one week, setting a new record. The album's lead single \" Mirotic \" became TVXQ's most successful single of their career. The song won a total of nine number-one trophies on Korean music programs The Music Trend , Music Bank , and M! Countdown , and was touted by international critics as a staple song of K-pop. Mirotic has sold over 600,000 copies, the first Korean album in six years to surpass half a million sales in South Korea. In October 2008, TVXQ released the Japanese version of \"Mirotic\", which topped the Oricon, breaking a record that the group had set with their previous single. TVXQ were the first Korean group to attend the Japanese New Year Eve's music festival K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen , and their invitation to the event was considered as one of the biggest highlights of their Japanese music career. In January 2009, the group released their twenty-fifth Japanese single \" Bolero / Kiss the Baby Sky / Wasurenaide \", which was another number one single for the group. \"Bolero\" was used as the theme song for the Japanese film Dance Subaru , and TVXQ also made brief cameo appearances in the film. In February 2009, the group kicked off their third international tour, the 3rd Asia Tour: Mirotic, which went through five cities in Asia. TVXQ released their fourth Japanese album The Secret Code in March 2009 and it debuted at number two on the Oricon. It managed to sell over 317,000 copies in Japan, earning a platinum certification. From May to July 2009, TVXQ went on their fourth headlining Japanese tour, the 4th Live Tour 2009: The Secret Code, which consisted of 21 shows to an audience of 279,500 people. The last two shows of the tour were at the Tokyo Dome , making TVXQ the first Korean group to perform at the venue. The concert's DVD, which was released in September 2009, pre-sold 107,000 copies and ultimately sold more than 353,000 copies. A number-one seller, TVXQ were the first foreign artist in twenty years to peak at first place on the Oricon's DVD rankings. In July 2009, members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu attempted to split with their Korean management S.M. Entertainment , claiming that their thirteen-year contract was excessively long, schedules were held out without permission of the members, and profits were unfairly distributed. In October 2009, the Seoul Central District Court granted the trio a temporary contract injunction, and TVXQ's group activities in Korea were ceased. In November 2009, Yunho and Changmin released a joint statement in support of S.M. Entertainment, and urged the trio to resolve their issues with their management quickly if they wished to continue their careers as TVXQ members. As a result of the legal battle, the Shenzhen show for the group's Mirotic tour was canceled a week before its scheduled date on November 21, 2009, thus prematurely ending the tour. Despite the injunction, Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu maintained their activities as TVXQ members under Avex's management in Japan, and the group continued to release new Japanese singles together until early 2010. However, the members' last public performance together was on December 31, 2009, at the 60th NHK K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen , where they performed their twenty-eighth single, \" Stand by U \". In January 2010, TVXQ released their twenty-ninth single, \" Break Out! \", which created a new record for the group. The single topped the Oricon and broke Elton John 's fourteen-year record of having the highest first-week sales for a foreign artist. On February 17, 2010, TVXQ released their Japanese greatest hits album Best Selection 2010 , a compilation of their number-one hits including new singles released after 2009's The Secret Code , such as \" Share the World / We Are! \", \"Stand by U\", and \"Break Out!\". The album sold over 400,000 copies in one week, earning RIAJ's double platinum status by the end of February. In March 2010, the group released their last single together, \" Toki o Tomete \", which was certified platinum by the RIAJ. On April 3, 2010, Avex declared the suspension of TVXQ's Japanese activities, stating that each member would be pursuing a solo career. However, a week later, Avex announced the formation of a \"special unit\" with members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu\u2014later known as JYJ \u2014a move that led to Yunho and Changmin's indefinite hiatus from music activities. After JYJ's announcement, S.M. Entertainment filed a lawsuit against JYJ to validate their contracts. In June 2010, JYJ submitted a lawsuit against S.M. Entertainment to void their exclusive contracts. Following the suits, S.M. Entertainment attempted to denounce JYJ and their new agency C-JeS, while Yunho and Changmin remained silent throughout the legal proceedings. In the meantime, Avex released two of TVXQ's greatest hits albums, the Complete Single A-side Collection and the Single B-side Collection , both of which were released on June 30. They were TVXQ's closing releases under their contract with Rhythm Zone. After several months of inactivity, Yunho and Changmin made their comeback appearances in August 2010 for the Seoul stop of the SM Town Live '10 World Tour , where they performed re-recorded versions of older TVXQ songs. Their two-piece performances garnered strong and supportive reactions from the audience, prompting Yunho and Changmin's decision to continue TVXQ activities without the other three. There were brief talks about recruiting new members, but their mentor Lee Soo-man suggested that they should continue as a duo act. Shortly after the concert, the duo began working on their comeback album and brought in a new line of producers, including E-Tribe and Outsidaz. In September 2010, Avex dropped JYJ, citing conflict with C-JeS. Avex then declared its support for remaining TVXQ members Yunho and Changmin on November 24, announcing that the duo have signed a new record contract with Rhythm Zone's sister label Avex Trax . Yunho and Changmin released TVXQ's comeback Korean album Keep Your Head Down on January 5, 2011. The album debuted at number one on the Gaon Albums Chart , and maintained its position for a second week. With 230,922 copies sold by mid-2011, Keep Your Head Down won the Album of the Year for the first quarter of 2011 at the Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards . The album's title single, \" Keep Your Head Down \" also stayed strong on the charts, winning seven number-one trophies on music shows The Music Trend , Music Bank , and M! Countdown. The Japanese version \"Keep Your Head Down\", which was released as a physical single in Japan on January 26, 2011, was a chart-topper and became TVXQ's second best-selling single in Japan, earning a platinum certification by the RIAJ. In March 2011, Keep Your Head Down was reissued with a new single, \" Before U Go \", and the repackaged album Before U Go peaked at number nine on the Gaon, pushing the album to be the third best-selling record of 2011 in South Korea. While promoting Keep Your Head Down , Yunho and Changmin spoke up for the first time about their 2010 hiatus and breakup with JYJ. According to Yunho, JYJ had \"exceedingly deep conflicts\" with their agency and the members had irreconcilable differences about their career. Changmin added that the team had worked so hard to the point where they felt like they could finally \"harvest the fruits of [their] labor\", yet instead of being happy they had to perform their final stage with heavy hearts. JYJ responded by saying that they did not regret their decision in leaving S.M. Entertainment. The lyrics of \"Keep Your Head Down\" also came under media scrutiny, with claims that they were directed at JYJ; however, TVXQ clarified that \"Keep Your Head Down\" was not a diss track, and that similar claims would still happen even if they were to release a different song with different lyrics. Yunho said, \"The song is about a man's mind towards a woman who had left him. We can sometimes find out that a certain song seems to talk about my own story. In this way it totally depends on the interpretation using our own thoughts.\" In July 2011, TVXQ released their thirty-second Japanese single \" Superstar \", which was certified gold by month's end. From July to August, the duo toured around Japan for Avex's A-Nation summer concert, and at the Tokyo stop, TVXQ performed as the closing act, breaking Ayumi Hamasaki 's record of closing the concert eight years in a row. TVXQ were the first foreign performers to close the festival. On September 28, the group released the Japanese album Tone , which earned them their first number-one studio album. It sold over 200,000 copies on its first week and earned RIAJ's platinum certification on its second week. TVXQ was the second overseas artist in Japan to achieve album sales of more than 200,000 in a week; the previous holder was Bon Jovi with their 2000 album, Crush . In the latter months of 2011, the duo performed for a string of K-pop music festivals around the world. They first performed at the 2011 Hallyu Dream Concert at Gyeongju Citizens' Stadium in South Korea on October 3. On October 9, TVXQ participated in the New York-Korea Festival , a concert produced by KBS Global to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Korea's entry into the United Nations. It was held in New Jersey. On October 23, TVXQ performed with SM Town at the SM Town Concert in New York at Madison Square Garden concert and garnered international media attention. TVXQ also participated in the 2011 K-pop Music Fest in Sydney, Australia, presented by JK Entertainment on November 12. Their new Japanese holiday single \" Winter \" was released on November 30. The single's A-track, \"Winter Rose\", was selected as the commercial song for Seven & i Holdings's Winter Gift , which premiered on November 8. TVXQ also contributed in their Korean management's December compilation album 2011 Winter SMTown \u2013 The Warmest Gift , and released the song \"Sleigh Ride\". On December 31, TVXQ performed \"Keep Your Head Down\" at the 62nd NHK Kohaku Uta Gassen . It was their first time performing at the Kohaku since the split, drawing media attention. TVXQ started 2012 with their comeback Japanese solo tour, the Tone tour , in January 2012. Tickets were sold out in a few minutes. Spanning a total of twenty-six shows in nine cities, the Tone Tour reached to an audience of 550,000, more than twice the audience count of their 2009 Japanese tour, The Secret Code. TVXQ also became the third foreign artist, after Michael Jackson and the Backstreet Boys , to perform at the Tokyo Dome for three consecutive days, attracting crowds of over 165,000. The Tone tour's 550,000 audience was also the largest mobilization for any Korean artist in Japan at the time, until TVXQ broke their own record with their 2013 Japan tour Time . With the release of their thirty-fourth chart-topping Japanese single, \" STILL \" in March 2012, TVXQ became the first foreign artist to release ten number-one singles in Japan. By July 2012, TVXQ came to be recognized as the first foreign artist in Japan to sell over 3.1 million CD singles, breaking a ten-year, ten-month long record that was previously held by the American vocal duo, The Carpenters . The group had a fan club event tour called \"The Mission\" that attracted over 100,000 fans TVXQ returned to South Korea in September 2012 to release their sixth Korean album Catch Me , followed by the announcement of their first world tour, the Live World Tour: Catch Me .

On November 26, TVXQ released Humanoids , the repackage of Catch Me , which also peaked at number one. Two days after the reissue's release, S.M. Entertainment and JYJ dropped their lawsuits against each other and reached a settlement, ending their three-year legal dispute. As part of the agreement, both parties stated that they would no longer interfere with each other's activities, and it was agreed upon that JYJ's contracts with S.M. Entertainment had ended in July 2009. On January 16, 2013, TVXQ announced on their official Japanese site the release of their sixth Japanese album Time for March 6. The album became their fastest selling studio album to date, selling over 277,000 copies in its first month of release. Its lead single, \" Catch Me -If You Wanna- \", sold over 137,000 copies, and topped the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, making the group the first foreign artist to have had twelve number ones on Oricon. In March the group took part in the TRF tribute album TRF Tribute Album Best for TRF's 20th anniversary. They sang a cover of \"survival dAnce ~no no cry more~\" and were the only Koreans to participate on the album. TVXQ set several records with their Time tour , which commenced at the Saitama Super Arena in April 2013. The duo became the first K-pop artist and the fourth foreign artist to embark on a five-dome tour, and were the first foreign musical act to perform at the Nissan Stadium as a headlining artist. The tour attracted a record audience of 850,000 people. The tour grossed US$90 million, breaking Tone's record. On December 26\u201327, 2013, TVXQ held two concerts titled Time Slip at the Korea International Exhibition Center in Ilsanseo-gu , South Korea to celebrate their tenth anniversary.

Similar to their 2015 album Rise as God , The Truth of Love was tagged as a \"special\" album release, so it was not regarded as an official studio release.

It was TVXQ's eighth album to debut atop the Oricon Albums Chart , breaking BoA 's record in becoming the first and only foreign artist in Japan to release eight number one albums. TVXQ have labeled their lead singles as \"SMP\", a supposedly experimental genre with a mix of orchestral pop , rock , hip hop , and contemporary R&B , topped with harmonizing vocals and high notes. Many of TVXQ's songs feature lyrics with dark social commentary. TVXQ's musical style has evolved over the years. Dance-pop and contemporary R&B ballads persisted throughout their releases, and they have released a cappella versions of their music. In their first two albums, TVXQ explored rap rock , and have collaborated with the rock band TRAX in those attempts. With their fourth Korean album Mirotic (2008), TVXQ delved into urban contemporary and electropop , and the album's lead single \" Mirotic \", a song marked by heavy-urban dance and Europop sounds, is considered one of the staple songs of K-pop. In the albums after the split, Yunho and Changmin experimented with more electronic dance music , traditional R&B, and pop songs with strong hip hop cadences. However, the duo's tenth anniversary album, Tense (2014), saw a drastic change in TVXQ's musical direction, in which acoustic genres such as adult contemporary pop music took focus. TVXQ's dance choreography has been called \"intense and powerful\". Their stage performances have been described as \"imaginative\" and \"captivating\", with Yunho and Changmin being lauded for their stability and stamina to perform live, with some live concert sets lasting for more than three hours. On an episode of Mnet's Idol Chart Show that aired on May 4, 2011, TVXQ were ranked number one among music removed (MR) idol singers. The five original members of TVXQ made their first appearance as actors in 2005, through the sitcom Rainbow Romance and their own seven-episode miniseries titled Banjun Theatre . In 2006, TVXQ starred in their second miniseries Vacation , also releasing a soundtrack. In 2012, Yunho and Changmin appeared in the biographical movie I AM. , a film that contained interviews from SM Town artists. The duo was featured in another SM Town film, the concert documentary SM Town: The Stage , in August 2015. In April 2016, during the duo's hiatus, they released their own Japanese concert film , Till , in Japan. In May 2018, the duo made cameo appearances on the television special drama Tensai Bakabon , playing as two hotel porters who appear again ten years later as members of a popular band. In November 2008, the Korean Commission of Youth Protection ruled that \" Mirotic \" was detrimental to youths and declared that the lyrics were provocative and overly sexual. As a result, the album was labeled with stickers indicating that it was unsuitable for people under 19 years old and any performances of the song would have to be broadcast after 10\u00a0PM. In response to the ruling, SM Entertainment agreed to make a clean version but also had filed an injunction to overrule the commission's decision. The lyrics were changed from \"I got you\" to \"I chose you\" and \"I got you under my skin\" to \"I got you under my sky.\" In March 2009, the Seoul Administrative Court ruled in favor of SM Entertainment. The Commission of Youth Protection announced they would appeal the ruling to a high court after having an emergency meeting and deeming that the phrase, \"I got you under my skin\", was inappropriate for minors. On July 31, 2009, three of the members\u2014 Hero Jaejoong , Micky Yoochun , and Xiah Junsu \u2014submitted an application to the Seoul Central District Court to determine the validity of their contract with their management agency, S.M. Entertainment . Through their lawyers, the trio stated that the 13-year contract was excessively long, schedules were held out without the confirmation or permission of the members, contract terms had been extended and changed without their knowledge or consent, and that the group's earnings were not fairly distributed to the members. Early termination penalty of their contract would cost them twice the profit that the group was estimated to earn for S.M. Entertainment in the rest of the contract period. The news of their lawsuit was enough to cause S.M. Entertainment's stock price to drop over 10% on the KOSPI . The Seoul Central District Court granted the three members a temporary contract injunction in October 2009 and stated that S.M. Entertainment could not interfere with their individual activities, thus placing a halt on TVXQ's group activities in South Korea. The members claimed that the contract was unfair and that they were left out of proper profit distribution. In response, S.M. Entertainment called a press conference and claimed that the lawsuit was not about unfair contracts or human rights, but motivated by the three members' greed to pursue their cosmetics business uninhibited by the restrictions of their exclusive contract with S.M. Entertainment. The agency submitted a complaint on criminal misdemeanor charges against the cosmetics company CreBeau; however, it was never brought to court by the prosecutor on grounds of insufficient evidence. The three replied that they hoped S.M. Entertainment would respect the court's decision. In response to the lawsuit, 120,000 TVXQ fans filed a petition against S.M. Entertainment's long-term contracts to the Seoul District Court. The Korean chapter of TVXQ's fanclub, Cassiopeia, also filed for compensation from S.M. Entertainment for the cancelled S.M. Town Live Concert, as both S.M. Entertainment and TVXQ initially stated that the concert would go on as planned. The concert was canceled a week before its scheduled date. TVXQ's Mirotic Asia Tour Concert in Shenzhen, which was scheduled to be held on November 21, 2009, was also canceled. Though TVXQ's activities in Korea were ceased, the three continued activities as TVXQ members until the end of the year in Japan, where they were managed by Avex. On April 3, 2010, Avex announced the indefinite suspension of TVXQ's Japanese activities. The three, later known as JYJ , signed a new contract with Avex to form a new special unit, which was announced on April 13, 2010. The trio released their debut Japanese EP, The... in September 2010. On February 17, 2011, the Seoul Central District Court dismissed S.M. Entertainment's injunction against the three, filed in April 2010 for damage compensation. In September 2012, the final decision on the case was postponed indefinitely by the Seoul Central District Court for mediation under the justice department. The lawsuit came to an end on November 28, 2012, with both parties mutually agreeing to withdraw their lawsuits, stating that the three members' contracts came to an end on July 31, 2009 and that both parties would mutually not interfere with each other's activities. An S.M. official was quoted as saying, \"We made a judgment that we don't have to manage the three members of JYJ any longer as they expressed their intention not to keep their activity as TVXQ\" and further added that they have decided to end the litigation \"to avoid bringing additional harm to U-Know Yunho and Max Changmin, who are active as TVXQ, and to avoid making any more unneeded issues\". TVXQ have endorsed products such as LG Mobile , Samsung ' s Anycall , sportswear Fila , and Oronamin C . Some of their songs have even been used as theme songs for television shows, commercials and motion pictures; [fn 2] such as One Piece , Chevrolet and Subaru . In 2011, the newly reformed TVXQ duo landed endorsement deals in Korea with brands such as Nike , The Shilla Duty Free, Pepsi NEX Zero , Missha , and most recently with Lacoste . In Japan, they have endorsed Seven & i Holdings , 7-Eleven products, the Seibu Silver card, 7-net shopping, and Ezaki Glico ice cream products. On August 14, 2012, Missha launched a new limited-edition TVXQ perfume set and had a special TVXQ fan signing event at the Missha store in Myeong-dong . On September 10, 2012, Missha announced that TVXQ had signed an exclusive contract with them to represent the brand worldwide and that their advertisements would soon be featured in some 1,000 stores across Asia. In 2005, the Los Angeles Tourism Corporation launched the \"See My L.A.\" campaign. TVXQ, along with label-mate BoA, became the spokespeople for the campaign. Since April 2007, TVXQ host their own weekly radio program, TVXQ Bigeastation on the Japan FM Network . On March 28, 2008, TVXQ were chosen as the \"Goodwill Ambassador for Asia\" by Universal Studios Japan in order to further promote the attractions of the USJ. TVXQ were also chosen to be the new faces for the Lotte duty-free shop , due to their popularity throughout Asia. The official fanclubs of TVXQ are Cassiopeia in South Korea and Bigeast in Japan. Their fandom color is red. According to news sources in 2008, Cassiopeia was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as \"the world's largest fanclub\" with more than 800,000 official members. However, the Guinness World Records later stated that \"[w]e currently have a category for the largest fanclub for a group, but no record has yet been set and we haven't been provided with any evidence\". TVXQ was also reported to have made it into the Guinness World Records in 2009 for being the Most Photographed Celebrities in the World, which was also directly refuted by Guinness World Records. When Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu started their lawsuit against their management, 120,000 Cassiopeia members filed a petition with the Seoul District Court in 2010 against S.M. Entertainment's long-term contracts. Cassiopeia also filed for compensation from S.M. Entertainment for the canceled SM Town Live Concert, as both SM and TVXQ initially stated that the concert would go on as planned. The concert was canceled a week before its scheduled date. TVXQ are known for breaking numerous sales and attendance records in Japan.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_the_Max", "name": "MC the Max", "labels": ["Music&NEW", "325 E&C"], "intro": "M.C the MAX (an acronym for Moon Child the MAX ) is a Korean rock band. They debuted in 2000 as a 4-member band under the name Moon Child. Upon one of the members leaving, the remaining three members re-grouped as M.C. the MAX. They were initially managed by the production company of Yoshiki , founding member of the Japanese heavy metal band X Japan . On September 1, 2016, it was reported that M.C the MAX had chosen to form their own music agency, 325 E&C. Their song \"Love Poem (\uc0ac\ub791\uc758 \uc2dc)\", from their 2nd album, topped the KBS chart in February 2004. To date, they have released 8 full-length albums, several singles, and began participating in soundtrack contributions for several Korean television series as well. M.C the MAX originally debuted in May 2000 with the release of their 1st album Delete as a quartet under the name \"Moon Child\": Lee Soo , J. Yoon , Jeon Min-hyuk and Heo Jung-min . Their 1st album consisted of mainly songs in the techno rock as well as the rock ballad genre. They released their 2nd album \uc0ac\ub791\ud558\ub2c8\uae4c (loosely translated to Because of Love ) on May 2001. Their 2nd album had a more similar sound to what they do today, consisting mainly of ballads mixed with a rock sound. Their title song \"\uc0ac\ub791\ud558\ub2c8\uae4c\" is a ballad song with some rock sounds mixed in. It was their last album to feature member Heo Jung-min, as he left the band in late 2001 for personal reasons. Their first two albums was met with limited success and after member Heo Jung-min left the band in 2001, it partially influenced their decision to disband. They then re-grouped as a trio with the remaining members under their current name \"M.C the Max\". The name change and the decision to regroup could be seen as means to release songs with improved quality than ever before, as well as be 'reborn' under a new identity. They released their first album as a trio with a new band name on October 31, 2002. They steered into music of the ballad genre, while keeping their rock sounds. They gained popularity in Japan with the support of Yoshiki from the popular Japanese rock band X Japan , and they also remade \" Tears \" from the band. The newly remake song was included in their first album M.C the Max with the name \" See You Later \". In addition, the second disc which was included with their first album consisted of songs entirely written and composed by the members themselves, which displays the members' musical abilities. Although the band still had the strong \"Moon Child\" image, through the resurgence under a new name, M.C the Max was building an image of a talented band. On December 2003, M.C the Max made their comeback with their second full-length album Love Is Time Sixth Sense . The title track \" Love Poem \" was composed by the frontman of Anzen Chitai , K\u014dji Tamaki . The new album will be released and sold simultaneously with Anzen Chitai's album. The album was met with great success and appealing to many Koreans, as M.C the Max won for the first time since debut on music programs. They won a total of 7 trophies with the title track and 2 triple crowns (winning consecutively for 3 times) on music programs such as the then Music Camp (the current Show! Music Core , and Inkigayo . The following year, they released their third full-length album Solitude Love on November 18, 2003. The title track \" Don't Be Happy \" was composed by a singer-songwriter in Japan, Kohmi Hirose who released the million-selling single Romance no Kamisama . Their 3rd album consisted of several songs of the ballad genre than before. However, a situation where members Jeon Min-hyuk and J. Yoon did not want to enter (preparation) sessions since the release of their second full-length album in 2003 was revealed. M.C the Max members then lost their desire to continue activities, forcing their widening activities to be stopped abruptly. Despite this, M.C the Max won an additional 5 trophies and another triple crown with their title track on more music programs such as M! Countdown . Even though the promotional activities for their third full-length album were stopped abruptly, that did not deter them from releasing a new album in 2005. They made a comeback after a year with their fourth full-length album The Rusted Love on November 23, 2005 and the title track \" \uc0ac\ub791\uc740 \uc544\ud504\ub824\uace0 \ud558\ub294 \uac70\uc8e0 \" (loosely translated to Love Is Going to be Painful ) won another 5 trophies on music programs. The members then expanded their entertainment activity rather than releasing mainstream music. They ventured into contributing soundtracks for dramas and also releasing a compilation album. Most notably, they released the soundtrack \" \uc0ac\ub791\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub124\uc694 \" for the television series Which Star Are You From , and also released the compilation album In Search for Love . At the end of 2006, the members' contracts with Paramount Entertainment expired. As they did not own the band name, Paramount Entertainment tried to debut \" M.C the Max 2 \" and member Lee Soo as a solo singer, independent from the group. Lee Soo had objected to the decision, stating that \"Unless this group consists of the 3 of us, we will not be able to release any music. The M.C in M.C the Max stands for Moon Child, and for the three of us only.\" which was against the policy of Paramount Entertainment. They then left the agency and signed a contract with a new agency named Vitamin Entertainment. However, Paramount Entertainment stated that they possessed the rights to the name M.C the Max until 2014, and had plans to add legal restrictions on the use of the name. After which, they filed a lawsuit for the name rights. Meanwhile, while the lawsuit was ongoing, M.C the Max was planning to release \" \ubcfc\ub54c\uae30 \uc0ac\ub791 \", a song which they had recorded earlier. Later on, they released the song together with the digital single \"The Perfect Ballad\". Lee Soo also released the soundtrack \"\ub098\ub9cc\uc758 \uc2ac\ud514\" which was a remake song original sung by Kim Don-kyu for the musical drama \"\ub3d9\ud654\". In late 2006, the court made a decision in favour of M.C the Max, and Paramount Entertainment had to retract their decision to debut \" M.C the Max 2 \". M.C the Max also claimed ownership for the four full-length albums they've released under the agency up till now. M.C the Max then made a surprise announcement that they will release their fifth full-length album Returns on April 18, 2007. The album consists of songs that goes beyond the different types of ballad and traditional rock sounds. They stated that one of the few factors was to break the perception that M.C the Max was a ballad band. After the release of their fifth full-length album, M.C the Max also planned on releasing another repackaged album to meet their fans twice through album promotions. After the promotional activities for their album has been completed, Lee Soo also worked with the vocalist of Rumble Fish , Choi Jin-yi on the duet \" Requiem \". Together with Choi Jin-yi, they also started working on Lee Soo's solo album \"I Am\" which was to be released on May 2008. Both J. Yoon and Jeon Min-hyuk also participated in the preparation sessions. J. Yoon and Davink was also active in project activities, being part of the electronica project band Monotonik . J. Yoon also collaborated with Shin Hae-chul who had produced their first album under the name Moon Child and their upcoming fifth full-length album to form the project group \" Wittgenstein \". Among news of the members' solo and project activities, rumours that M.C the Max also began to spread. However, M.C the Max had squashed the rumours as they announced they were making their comeback with the release of their sixth full-length album VIA 6 on September 30, 2008 after a year and 5 months. To commemorate the release of their sixth full-length album, M.C the Max also announced that they were going on a national cpncert tour titled Eclipse around Korea.

In 2009, M.C the Max released the live album \" Moonchild Is Invincible \" which contained the songs sung live in the 2007 concert of the same name. On June 13 and 14, M.C the Max members held their final concert titled \" Goodbye for a moment \" at Yonsei University before their military enlistment. A few days later on June 18, during the free time between their final concert and the date of their military enlistment, they released the special album \" Rewind & Remind \" online. The special album will also be made available at music stores on June 23. On June 25, Lee Soo started his military service by enlisting as a public servant and entered the training camp.

As stated by LUV in an interview, LUV stands for \"Love yoUr Voice\", stating that everyone should love themselves and their strengths and flaws in their hearts. They were first featured on JTL 's \"A Better Day\" as the female singers on the song. Shortly thereafter, they debuted with \"Orange Girl\", which was very popular, as it was performed numerous times. They released their second single, \"I Still Believe in You\", with an accompanying music video soon thereafter. Their first album, Story , was released on May 15, 2002. Sometime in August, LUV promoted \"Tears\" from the same album and performed it at a military concert along with groups such as S.E.S. and Fin.K.L. They were credited as having massive potential, and were compared numerous times to S.E.S. Although the band was popular and had a large fanbase, they did not last long, as each member had their own dream. The band quickly split after one year of mild success and pursued personal goals. Jeon Hye-bin released a solo album and pursued an acting career, and her past experiences in the group led to her success as a singer. Oh Yeon-seo pursued an acting career, and Jo Eun-byul has been working as a stage actress in musicals in the playhouse district of Daehangno since LUV disbanded, although she was featured in a performance of JTL 's \"A Better Day\" in 2005. Eun-byul, now known as LeeBie ( \uc774\ube44 ), has released a solo mini-album titled \uc624\ub298 \ud558\ub8e8\ub9cc (This Day) on October 26, 2009. On November 11, 2009, LUV reunited for a showcase, but a reunion is not completely clear. On March 30, 2010, their album, Story was released for purchase on iTunes after eight years.\n"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leessang", "name": "Leessang", "labels": ["Jungle Entertainment", "Leessang Company"], "intro": "Leessang ( Korean : \ub9ac\uc30d ) was a South Korean hip hop duo, composed of Kang Hee-gun (\"Gary\" or \"Garie\") and Gil Seong-joon (\"Gil\"). Formed in 2002, the duo has released eight albums to date: two self-titled records in 2002 and 2003, Library of Soul in 2005, Black Sun in 2007, Baekajeolhyeon (\ubc31\uc544\uc808\ud604) in 2009, Hexagonal in late 2009, Asura Balbalta in 2011 and Unplugged in 2012. Their last three albums broke numerous records and guided their entry to the mainstream Korean music industry. In 1997, Gary joined X-Teen, a hip hop group, where he met Gil. They released two albums. Gary later said that he had neither the looks nor the talent so they left the group. Gary and Gil then joined Honey Family . They released two successful albums in 1999 and 2000. The other members were Digitty, Miryo , Park Myung Hou, Jura, Young Poon, and Su-Jung. To date, the group is still acknowledged as one of the best hip hop groups of all time because of their unique blend of rapping styles. Gary, Gil, and Diggity collaborated to form a \"Leessam Trio\" ( sam means three in Korean), and released a compilation album called 2000 Korea in the year 2000. Diggity eventually left the group. Gil and Gary changed the name to \"Leessang\". Diggity later stated in an interview that part of the reason he left is because when success went to his head he felt like a celebrity. Gil managed to borrow 2 billion won to fund their first album. With no formal musical training, the duo learned as they were producing by spending 400 hours straight inside the studio. Through their efforts, they managed to produce 60 songs. On June 27, 2002, Leessang released their first album, Leessang of Honey Family . Their breakaway hit was the title track featuring Jung-in . The song, \"Rush\", which uses an identical baseline to \"You Are Everything\" by the Stylistics and was released one day after Nelly's Grammy winning song - \"Dilemma\", won the hip-hop music awards from the Mnet KM Music Video Festival. Many credited the perfect blend of Jung-in, Gil and Gary's voices as one of the reasons for the song's success. This was also the beginning of their long partnership with Jung-in. \"Rush\" remains in Leessang's repertoire to date. [ when? ] They released their second album, Jae,Gyebal (\uc7ac,\uacc4\ubc1c) on May 22, 2003. Jung-in once again provided the female vocals for their second hit song \"Leessang Blues\", written and composed by Gary. When they made their \"best of\" album titled Leessang Special , a workflow was developed that has loosely remained the same. Gary writes most of the lyrics, Gil does the music, and they both produce. Despite their success, they were still largely underground. Gary said in episode 98 of Strong Heart that they were so \"unknown\" that they were blocked by security when they came to receive their first major award. Their mainstream breakthrough happened when they released their third studio album Library of Soul on October 14, 2005. On May 17, 2007, their fourth album Black Sun was released. Leessang said that every song on the album tells a story of their life. They eventually won Cyworld Digital Music Awards: Song of the Month when the song stayed on the charts for 4 straight weeks. It took them two years to release their fifth album, Baekajeolhyeon . The title track, \"Champion\", was dedicated to boxer Yo-Sam Choi , who was very close to Gary and Gil. Choi died on the ring in 2008. Gary decided to direct the music video, which was a move that set the precedent on all their succeeding music videos. In 2009, Leessang signed with a new label Jungle Entertainment , founded by hip-hop legend Tiger J.K. (aka Drunken Tiger). It was later reported that Jungle is one of the few labels that give their artists more artistic control and gives probably the highest percentage in rights and royalties. Leessang and Ryoo Seung-Bum toured to Sydney, Australia for the first time in this year with show producer Leonard Dela Torre. They released their sixth album, Hexagonal on October 6, 2009. The lead single, \"Girl Who Can't Break-Up and Boy Who Can't Leave\" featured Jung-in once more. The song went straight to #1 on KBS Music Bank where it stayed at #1 for three weeks straight. Another song in the album, \"Let's Meet Now\", was a collaboration with the band Jang Gi Hwa and Faces. It was used for Fish & Grill's TV Commercial. Leessang's seventh album, Asura Balbalta , was released August 25, 2011. The title song, \"I Turned Off The TV\", occupied the top position on Billboard's K-Pop Hot 100, and every other song from the album charted. \"I Turned Off The TV\" was banned by all TV networks and radio stations because of explicit sexual content. However, it was reported to earn US$500,000 within the first month of release. Gary later said that they were becoming more comfortable talking about different sensitive issues as they age. In 2011, LeeSsang embarked on their first nationwide solo tour titled Leessang Theatre. [ citation needed ] Gary revealed on Strong Heart (TV series) that the inspiration to his songs \"Leessang Blues\", \"I'm Not Laughing\", \"Ballerino\", \"Girl Who Can't Break up, Boy Who Can't Leave\" and \"You're the Answer to a Guy Like Me\" was his ex-girlfriend of almost 7 years. In May 2012, Leessang released their eighth album, Unplugged . It was a fulfillment of their long time dream to collaborate with different artists from different genres, using a full band via an analogue recording. That same month, the duo announced that they created Leessang Company. They intended to create live events that were geared towards putting up quality and innovative live shows. Jungle Entertainment remains their label but they will produce and direct all their live shows under the new company. On July 15, 2012, Gary and Gil were both featured on Psy 's \"Seventy Seven 101.\" Psy, Kim Jin Pyo, and Leessang all worked together on the song. The song and the album were restricted because of explicit lyrics in \"Seventy Seven 101\". In December 2012, they performed a one-night only show with the band YB with whom they collaborated for the song \"Someday\", \"Run\" and \"Madman\". After strong public demand, they decided to do a short nationwide tour with YB. They also went to their first U.S. Tour. They had a show in New York and Los Angeles, and both were sold out. On July 14, 2015 Leessang reached the top of multiple charts with their single \"Kaleidoscope\" featuring Mi Woo. On April 6, 2017, it was reported that they may have disbanded as they have parted their own ways and work solely, after establishing their own music labels. Leessang has been respected even before their mainstream success despite signing with a fairly non-mainstream label, rather than a well-known large K-pop entertainment company. Leessang are known to write and produce their own songs, direct their music videos, and keeping their private lives separate from their professional work. They are also credited for being one of the few artists to help non-idol singers and musicians get some attention by the mainstream public. They are often regarded as a physically unappealing group, especially in the variety shows they partake in. However, since the success of Hexagonal , Asura Balbalta and Unplugged , they have been known to support themselves despite not receiving media attention based on their attractive looks. Gary is known for his off-tempo rapping while Gil's voice is nationally known for its huskier approach. They are also widely regarded for their live performances. They are known to receive constant favorable reviews for their live performances and are particularly known for showing personal stories of their own upbringing. "}

Although F-iV consists of four members, the group's name is pronounced like the word five in English.

Moreover, the group states that the iV in the group's name is supposed to be like the Roman numerals IV , which is equivalent to the number 4 like the number of members in the group. The four members of F-iV were first formed as a group by their label H&J Entertainment in 1999 due to the rise in popularity of R&B music from groups such as Fly to the Sky and Brown Eyes , and were recruited for their music talents such as composition and arrangement. The group spent three years training in preparation for their eventual debut. On September 25, 2002, F-iV released their debut album F-iV [Faiv] , which featured songs with R&B and ballad elements.

They are known for having combined genres and different styles of hip hop throughout their career, which has seen the release of eleven studio albums since their debut in 2003, as well as for their coverage of diverse lyrical themes. The group went on hiatus between 2010\u20132012 whilst two of the members served mandatory military service . Upon their return, YG Entertainment signed Mithra Jin and DJ Tukutz on July 25, 2012, with Tablo having already released a solo album under the label. They have received international acclaim, winning several music awards in Korea and becoming the second Korean act to play at Coachella . Epik High formed in 2001 upon frontman Tablo's return to South Korea after being educated in Vancouver and Stanford . With the addition of Mithra Jin and DJ Tukutz, the group made their beginnings in the underground hip hop scene in Seoul, performing with other Korean hip hop groups such as CB Mass and as part of the \"Movement Crew\", one of the largest hip hop crews of the time in South Korea. As the genre was unpopular among mainstream audiences, the group was relatively unknown early on in their career, with critics seeing little market for \"lyrically complex music\" that did not match the K-pop model of the time. Their first performance was to a small audience at the amusement park Everland in 2002. They released their debut album, Map of the Human Soul , under Woollim Entertainment in 2003, and began to gain success with the release of their second album, High Society (2004). Swan Songs was intended to be Epik High's final album, following the poor performance of their previous two releases; however, it became a mainstream hit and made them one of the most popular hip hop groups in Korea. The album was a chart success with the title track, \"Fly\", reaching number one on domestic charts. \"Fly\" also featured on the soundtracks for FIFA 07 and Pump It Up . Another of the album tracks, \"Paris\" featuring Loveholics ' Jisun, was also a hit in Japan and Korea. The album was repackaged the following year as Black Swan Songs , which included remixes of several tracks. Originally set for release in October 2006, Epik High's fourth album Remapping the Human Soul was released on January 23, 2007. The two upbeat lead singles, \"Fan\" and \"Love Love Love\", were hits, while the rest of the album was darker and tackled diverse themes including sexual crime, war, religion, and education. The album was reportedly censored by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism as a result of its lyrical and thematic content. Despite this, it was a commercial success in both Korea and Japan. It went on to sell 120,301 copies during the year, making it the third best-selling album of 2007 in South Korea. During this time, the group spoke of their \"no genre, just music\" philosophy, expressing frustration with \"narrow\", \"out-dated and isolated\" perceptions of the hip hop genre. Over 50,000 copies of their fifth studio album entitled Pieces, Part One were pre-ordered before its release in April 2008. The album's release was followed by music videos for the singles \"One\", \"Breakdown\", and \"Umbrella\". After the album's success, Epik High released the EP Lovescream to acclaim in October, with the EP's title track \"1 Minute 1 Second\" topping online music charts. In early 2009, Epik High parted ways with Woollim Entertainment and founded Map The Soul, an independent record label that consisted of Epik High, MYK , Planet Shiver and Dok2 . They released their seventh work, a \"book album\" entitled \u9b42: Map the Soul , on March 27 and distributed it exclusively on Epik High's website.

Epik High's sixth album, [e] , was released on September 16 with the title single \"Wannabe (\ub530\ub77c\ud574)\" featuring Mellow, an electronic pop track critiquing K-pop trends. The studio album contained 30 tracks in a 2-CD format. Its release was followed by a South Korean tour, beginning on September 19. On October 15, 2009, DJ Tukutz enlisted for two years in mandatory military service , two days after his marriage. He was discharged in August 2011. While DJ Tukutz was conscribed, Epik High's seventh studio album Epilogue was released under Woollim Entertainment on March 9, 2010 to chart success. The music video for its title track, \"Run\", featured several members of the Woollim-signed boy band Infinite prior to their debut: L as the video's protagonist, Sunggyu as guitarist, Woohyun as bassist, and Sungjong as keyboardist. Infinite's Hoya and Dongwoo also served as backup dancers during promotions of the single on various music shows. Shortly after the album's release, Mithra Jin also entered into mandatory military service and served two years between August 3, 2010 \u2013 May 14, 2012. He entered the 102 reserve in Chuncheon and served as an infantry rifle soldier, a member of the military band, and a GOP soldier before settling at the Defense Media Agency (DEMA). During the two-year hiatus that followed, Tablo (who is a Canadian citizen and therefore was not required to carry out military service) signed a four-year contract with YG Entertainment and released a solo album titled Fever's End on November 1, 2011.

Christina Chu left the official line up due to her work in Canada , and Horan stepped in to fill her spot. Chu occasionally contributes her vocals to the band, although she is often an uncredited guest artist. Clazziquai released their first studio album, Instant Pig , in May 2004. The album received critical acclaim, which led to more than five songs from the album being used in six television commercials. The remixed English version of the song, \"Come To Me\", in its remix album Zbam was released in November 2004, and was later used as a song in a television commercial featuring David Beckham . Fantastic Plastic Machine praised Clazziquai as a new band to lead the \" Hallyu \". In 2005, Clazziquai's \"Be My Love\" and \"She Is\", were featured in the South Korean hit television drama, My Lovely Samsoon . These two major theme songs also raised the ratings of the series up 50%. Clazziquai had hoped then that people's imagination towards their music would not 'decrease as a result of their unexpected popularity'. In September 2005, Clazziquai released their second album, Color Your Soul claiming it had a \"raw, funkier feel presenting a combination of electronic music and [an] emphasized acoustic genre\". A remix album entitled Pinch Your Soul was released early the following year. In June 2007, Clazziquai's third album, Love Child of the Century , was released. A remix album, Robotica , was released later in the year. After the album's release, the members of Clazziquai grew busy with their own work, which started false rumors that Clazziquai could be disbanding. In 2008, a video game for the PlayStation Portable featuring many Clazziquai songs titled DJ Max Portable Clazziquai Edition was released. These songs were later released as part of the special album Metrotronics . In July 2009, Clazziquai released their fourth album, Mucho Punk , featuring the single \"Wizard of OZ\" which had been featured in an LG commercial that year. In concordance to Mucho Punk , Clazziquai released Japanese album, Mucho Musica , and later released a remix album, Mucho Mix . The remix version of the original album was released in South Korea later in the year as Mucho Beat . In December 2012, Clazziquai released the single, \"Can't Go On My Own\", as part of the Can We Get Married? OST. In February 2013, the band released their fifth album, Blessed , making it into the top ten of Gaon 's weekly album chart. They later held three 'Be Blessed' concerts throughout May and June. In September 2014, Clazziquai released their sixth album, Blink . They held a concert shortly after the release to celebrate their tenth anniversary as a band. In mid 2015, they held a concert at the Understage in Seoul. In September 2016, Clazziquai released their seventh album, Travellers . After the album's release the band held a concert at the Blue Square in Seoul. On September 10, 2019, the band released a brand new single, called What If . The song does not feature Horan, having new artist Kim Soo-young singing instead. In the accompanying press release, it was mentioned that Clazziquai will continue the collaboration project with various singers starting with the respective single and an EP is planned for a 2020 release. At the moment, it is uncertain whether Horan shall resume activities with the group or not. "}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewelry_(band)", "name": "Jewelry (group)", "labels": ["Star Empire", "Giza Studio"], "intro": "Jewelry ( Korean : \uc96c\uc5bc\ub9ac ) was a South Korean girl group formed in 2001 by Star Empire Entertainment . The group was the longest-running Korean girl group (with more than 2 members) until their disbandment in 2015, surpassing super-group Baby V.O.X. Jewelry founding members Park Jung-ah , Lee Ji-hyun , Jun Eun-mi and Jung Yoo-jin debuted in 2001 with their first album Discovery . After less-than-stellar sales of the first album, two of the singers (Jun Eun-mi and Jung Yoo-jin) were replaced by Seo In-young and Cho Min-ah. A year later, their second album, Again , was released, with much better results. Full of strong R&B ballads (as opposed to the sexy dance songs that were popular at that time), the album quickly yielded two high-charting singles \u2014 \"Again\" and \"Tonight\" \u2014 which started the group's rise to popularity. This was quickly followed by their third album Beloved , which had a very cutesy theme. Their first single \"\ub2c8\uac00 \ucc38 \uc88b\uc544\" (\"I Really Like You\") was very poppy and had Jewelry adopt a cutesy concept to match the song, with colorful outfits and perky dances. The title track, Be My Love , was also promoted. Even though album sales for Again and Beloved were great, the group was unhappy with their current image, and did not want to be known for only their cute and innocent songs. After the success of their second album, Jewelry left for Japan to start on their career there in 2004 with their first single Kokoro ga Tomaranai under the independent label Giza Studio . After releasing a few materials there with mediocre sales, the group eventually left to return to their native country to release their fourth album. By the time their fourth album Superstar came out in the beginning of 2005, Jewelry has since shed their \"cute image\" concept. Following the trend in Korean pop , they became sexier and more womanly, which helped bring about their current level of success. The first single \"Superstar\" (written by Shinhwa member Lee Min-woo ) was a driven rock song and surprisingly became a huge hit. They followed this up with the sexy R&B number \"Passion\", which also charted strongly. Both of these singles prominently featured \"sexy\" member Seo In-Young dance scantily-clad in short shorts, which brought the group much press attention (both positive and negative). In 2006, Jewelry took a break from the Korean music industry in order to focus on Japan. During that time, member Ji-hyun left to pursue an acting career. In early November, news leaked out that another member, Cho Min-ah , had also left, which forced their record company to look for a second replacement member. As Park Jung-Ah and Seo In-young had solo projects, a new album was not expected until mid-2007. In early 2008, Jewelry returned to the music scene with their new members Baby J and Eunjung with the release of their fifth album, Kitchi Island . Released on February 20, 2008, the album featured the single \"One More Time\", a cover of In-Grid 's song, composed by Sannie Carlson ( Whigfield ). \"One More Time\" has mirrored the success of Jewelry's 2005 hit single, \"Superstar\" in South Korea, reaching the No. 1 spot on MBC's Music Core and KBS's Music Bank , two weeks after the song's debut. The single has also achieved success online, topping the charts of various music websites, including Melon, Dosirak, Bugs Music, M.Net.com, Muz and Juke On. \"One More Time\" became the most successful single of Jewelry to date, staying on the no.1 spot for 7 weeks in a row on MBC's Music Core and KBS's Music Bank . In spring of 2008, a second single, \"\ubaa8\ub450 \ub2e4 \uc27f\" (\" Everybody Shh! \"), was released and promoted. The group was awarded with a Daesang (\ub300\uc0c1, a \"Top Award\"), for highest digital sales in 2008. In early 2009, members Baby J and Eunjung returned to the Korean music market, under the name \"Jewelry S\", debuting as a sub-group. Their mini-album, Sweet Song was released in digital format on January 22, and the full single was made available on February 6. Baby J and Eunjung made their live comeback on M. Countdown on February 5, where they sang \"\ub4e4\uc5b4\ubd10\" ( \"Listen\" ) and the lead single from their mini-album, \"\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\" ( \"Date\" ). The music video for \"Date\" features cameo appearances from Jewelry members Park Jung-ah and Seo In-young. Jewelry released a new single in June 2009 titled \"Super Star\" with the song \"Rally\" featuring rapper Nassun. The song was for MNet's talent competition, Superstar K . A music video was also released and featured the group's performance of the song on Mnet's M! Countdown as well as scenes of Superstar K. About a week prior to the album release, the song \"Strong Girl\" was released as a digital single. Their 6th album, Sophisticated , was released on August 27 with the music video for the title track, \"Vari2ty\", being released on the same day. In December 2009 Seo In-young and Park Jung-ah announced their departure. Korean media reported that Superstar K top 10 contender Semi was likely to replace them. A repackaged edition of their 6th album, End And.. was released on December 17, 2009 with the single \"Love Story\". On June 14, 2010, it was announced Semi would be joining Jewelry with a comeback happening later during the year. A few months later it was announced the groups comeback would occur in 2011. On January 18, 2011, Kim Ye-won joined Jewelry. A digital single, \"Back It Up\" was released on January 27 along with its accompanying music video. They made their comeback performance during the same day on M! Countdown . The single reached a certain amount of success however it was not as successful as their previous works. On May 9, Jewelry's label, Star Empire Entertainment, shared some old videos of Jewelry rehearsing various songs. Two days later they announced with teaser photos the group would release a new single which was later revealed to be \"Pass\". The single was released on May 16 along with a teaser MV featuring label mate Hwang Kwang Hee of ZE:A . No music video was released for \"Pass\". On September, Semi and Yewon joined the sub-unit Jewelry S and announced they would release a single entitled \"Ames Room Vol.2\", the title track being the song \"Forget It\". The single was released on September 20, and the music video was released the same day. Yewon joined the hit variety show Invincible Youth 2 to represent her group. The show started on November 17, 2011 and ended on November 12, 2012. In 2012, Jewelry was originally scheduled to make a comeback in July. However, this was delayed until October. On September 21, Jewelry announced their comeback with their first mini album \"Look At Me\", with the title track as the same name. The mini album was released on October 11. \"Look At Me\" debuted at #42 on the Gaon Digital Charts and later peaked at #23. The mini album also debuted at #7 on the Gaon National Physical Album Charts. The music video was also released during the same day and the group had their comeback performance on Music Bank the next day. During mid November, Jewelry was announced to release a digital single around early December. But towards the end of November, Star Empire Entertainment, announced the digital single was postponed and the group would spend more time preparing for their next release. In 2013, Star Empire announced that Jewelry will release a digital single in July called \"Hot & Cold\". On March 3, 2014, it was revealed that Eunjung's contract had expired and she would be leaving the group. Yewon was cast in the weekend drama Hotel King , in the role of an enthusiastic front desk officer. On April 17, 2014, Yewon hosted the Mnet talk show M Countdown Begins with K.Will . Meanwhile, Semi starred in a new sitcom, Boarding House no 24 as Park Semi. On November 19, 2014, Baby J revealed that she will be leaving Jewelry as her contract expired last August. It was also revealed that Semi would not be renewing her contract after it expired that month. On January 7, 2015, the group was officially confirmed as disbanded. On April 8, 2018, members Baby J, Eunjung, Inyoung and Jungah reunited on the JTBC 's show Sugarman 2 , where they performed their 2008 single One More Time . "}

Following the release of their first album, the group won Best New Artist at several major South Korean music awards. After Eani left the group in 2001, the group introduced new member Bona in 2002. Chakra ultimately released three more albums and disbanded in 2006. Chakra officially debuted on February 26, 2000 at Music Camp with their first single Han , immediately calling attention, due to its Indian music concept. In March of the year the group released their first solo album titled \"Come A Come\" with singles titled Come A Come , Hey You and Sign of Love . The album was a success and sold +162,251 copies that led them to win many rookie awards in South Korea, including the SBS Music Awards, the Golden Disk Awards and the Mnet Asian Music Awards. That same year, Chakra released their special Christmas album entitled \"Ringing Jingle Bells\" with the main ballad single \"Lonely Christmas\". In 2001, the group reached its peak when they released their second album \"Chakra'Ca\", along with the main single \"End\". It became their first #1 album in South Korea. The main theme focused on African music as the main concept of the album. The album sold +86,635 copies and won in the category of Best Singer dressed at the SBS Music Awards. The other success of this album was \"Oh My Boy\". At the time it was already very difficult to finance the group, due to a scam that happened to a new company called \"Kiss Entertainment\". In this process, Eani decided to leave the group at the end of 2001. They introduced a new member, Bona, in 2002. In 2002 they released their third album \"Chakra\" with the lead single \"Come Back\". In 2003, they released their last album, \"Tomato\" along with the first single From Me To You, which was a success. The album sold 23,450 copies and at the end of the year, Chakra won again in the Best Dance category at the SBS Music Awards, from this album there are other famous songs like \"True Love In This World Is A Live\" and the ballad \"Why Im The Only One\". After the end of the promotions of the last album in 2004, Ryeo-won left Chakra to continue her career as an actress. In 2005, it was planned to release a new album and do new activities, but the album could not be released due to the company's financial difficulties. Chakra members also suffered a lot of difficulties at this time, and the audience was almost indifferent to the actions of this Chakra triad; this caused Eun to leave the group. At the time, only HwangBo and Bona remained as members of Chakra. In 2006, Chakra disbanded.\n"}

Choiza and Gaeko originally met in the sixth grade but before forming CB Mass they began an underground hip hop group named kod along with Sixpoint and ZASON, who joined in 1998. In the same year, Choiza and Gaeko met a fellow rapper Curbin and created CB Mass. The group debuted in 2000 under Drunken Tiger 's wing and released Massmediah to moderate success. In total they produced three albums: MassMediah in 2000, Massmatics in 2001, and Massappeal in 2003.

Their second album Massmatics was their most popular, with 120,000 copies sold in Korea. At the height of their success however there were continuous rumours that they would break up and their last album added weight to this speculation with just Gaeko and Choiza appearing on most of the songs. In the first song of Dynamic Duo's first album Gaeko raps \"He liked standing in front of mirrors than music/ He worshipped cash more than friendship/ What he left with us is only betrayal,\" in a barely concealed reference to Curbin.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rania_(band)", "name": "Rania (group)", "labels": ["DR Music"], "intro": " Rania ( Korean : \ub77c\ub2c8\uc544 ; shortened from \"Regeneration Idol of Asia\"), formerly known as BP Rania (shortened from \"Black Pearl Rania\") is a South Korean girl group formed by DR Music in 2011, created by American Teddy Riley . They debuted as Rania with their debut single album Teddy Riley, The First Expansion In Asia with title track \"Dr Feel Good\" released in April 2011. Rania was originally set to debut in mid 2010 as the third generation of Baby V.O.X. , however their record company DR Music decided to rebrand them as a new group named Rania with eight members: Saem (later known as Yina), Lucy (later known as Jooyi), Riko, Joy, Di, T-ae, Xia and Sarah. T-ae, Riko and Yina were chosen to star alongside former 2PM member Jay Park in his movie Hype Nation, causing DR Music to push back the group's debut. At the beginning of 2011, Sarah Wang made her decision to leave the group and was replaced by Chinese trainee Yijo. Before the addition of Yijo, Thai Korean trainee Data (Song Daeun) and Canadian Korean trainee Minhee (Moon Minhee) were set to take Sarah's place. However, Minhee left due to parental disapproval due to her age (at the time she was 15), and Data left due to homesickness (her family resided in Thailand). Rania made their debut in April 2011 as an eight-member group, consisting of Saem, Jooyi, Riko, Joy, Di, T-ae, Xia and Yijo. However, upon their debut EP's release, Yijo was not present for live performances. It was later revealed that Yijo was having issues with her work visa. She left the group shortly after. On April 6 they performed on KBS ' Music Bank , with the title track \"Dr Feel Good\", composed by producer Teddy Riley . The song was originally given to Lady Gaga . However, since their music video and live performances caused controversy in Korea as some viewers felt that their image and concept were too provocative, Rania were forced to change their choreography and make minor changes to the outfits. After the conclusion of \"Dr Feel Good\" promotions, the group returned in June with their first digital single \"Masquerade\" (also composed by Riley). Despite having planned an American debut, the group made no advancements. Shortly afterwards Riley announced that he would have nothing more to do with the group after falling out with their record label, releasing a statement saying \"I wish them the best. It's not the girls I dislike, I love Rania, they would be better with me at SM Entertainment. Their manager does shady business, used me for my music. I love Rania, I just don't like their company business. That's why they are not getting bigger. They don't do business upfront. They used my name every where then back door me on the group. It's ok if they will regret it. If they leave that company, I will sign them up quickly. Please know the facts before attacking me. Attack their company. Such great talent will be wasted if they don't get better support.\" The group released their second EP, Time to Rock Da Show , on November 16, 2011. The music video for its title track, \"Pop Pop Pop\", written by Brave Brothers , was revealed four days later. Joy suddenly went on hiatus at this time, which DR Music claimed was because her parents' house had been affected in the flood which occurred in Thailand at the time of the release, and later left Rania in June 2012. In a series of now-deleted tweets, she wrote \"To everyone, I'm sorry I let you guys down so many times, but I\u2019ve been thinking about it for months. I think I can't go back to stand on that place anymore. [...] I can't go back anymore. Thanks for all of your love and all of your hope, thank you so much and I feel so sorry that I [am disappointing beloved fans]\u2026From now\u2026I think I can't be in the entertainment [industry] or back to be a singer anymore since I was sick\u2026But I haven't got any confidence to go back to do it. I'm sorry that I made you all have to wait for me\u2026and I made you all feel confused. Thank you so much for gifts, kindness, love that you give me. Thank you.\" On 30 May 2012, Rania performed a new song named \"Killer\" at the Dream Concert. They made a comeback on September 16 with second digital single \"Style\", whose music video was revealed on September 20. Jooyi did not participate in this comeback, although DR Music claimed she was still a member of the group. Rania released the lead single \"Just Go\" on March 8, 2013, along with their third mini album, also titled Just Go (Goodbye's The New Hello) . They also announced to debut in America in summer 2013. Empire Records was to be handling the girls' distribution while Fireworks was to handle their American management. Larry Rudolph and Adam Leber , two of Britney Spears ' managers, decided to be Rania's managers throughout their U.S. promotions. Starting May 21, Rania began filming for their MTV reality show Road to Fame in Los Angeles and other cities across the U.S. The show would feature the group's preparations for their U.S. debut and would air for three months. It was also revealed that the album would feature collaborations with both Snoop Dogg and 2 Chainz . However, Rania's American debut was delayed again in June. Instead, they began to film a CF for Woongjin Waterpark Play\u00b0C and released a special digital single titled \"Up\" for fans on July 5. In May 2014, the group signed with Spanish label INGENIOmedia and confirmed they would have a comeback in July with \"Acceleration\", with a second round of promotions in September. The label also confirmed that they were looking for a sixth member to replace Riko, who was absent from the group since \"Just Go\". Following an incident where a staffer at INGENIOmedia leaked Rania's comeback track to a sasaeng fan , the company severed ties with the group, stating they were \"taking too long\". INGENIOMedia later released a statement saying that they were not looking for a member to replace Riko, apologizing for any confusion, and said that any news on member changes would have to come from Rania's company. In late 2014, Saem stopped attending public events and deactivated her official social media accounts. This led to intense fan speculation that she had left the group, but DR Music did not release an official statement regarding her situation. Soon afterwards, DR Music announced Riko's departure, releasing a statement saying: \"After the completion of the promotions of the single \"Style\", Riko told us with that she would take her university entrance exams to study a career, she asked for a three year break to complete her university studies and once she graduated from college, she could return to the group as a member of RaNia, but the problem came back this year when she reproached subjects in the university, she made us aware of this situation and asked for a year more absence that we found impossible since although she promotes or not with the group, we as a company should continue paying a normal salary, And That is unfair for us and the other members of the group, because she can not postpone her absence anymore, she decided to leave the group and the agency.\" DR Music later added a new member, Sharon Park, who was a model before joining the group. In January 2015, Jooyi stopped attending live performances with RaNia. When asked for an update on the situation, DR Music claimed that she was simply on hiatus. In April 2015, Sharon Park left the group to focus on her modeling career. In July 2015, the group made their appearance with two new members, trainees Seulji and Hyeme. In October 2015, they were announced to be having a comeback as a six-member group on November 6 with their third EP Demonstrate . On 3 November, Seulji and Hyeme were revealed as new members and it was announced that Demonstrate would feature African-American rapper Alexandra Reid, with the possibility of her becoming a new member of the group. On November 4, DR Music confirmed that Alexandra Reid had joined the group, while confirming Saem and Jooyi's departures. Alex is the first African-American woman to be an official member of a South Korean girl group. DR Music sent out a letter to fans that supported their Makestar project, informing them that RaNia's comeback had been pushed back to August 2016, and they were working on a Hyeme & Alex sub-unit instead. On July 13, 2016, however, Makestar announced that due to repeated failed attempts to contact DR Music about the project's progress and \"the continued irresponsible behavior and stance taken by the RaNia project creator, and our unwillingness to ignore the inconvenience this is causing to the project participants\", the project would be terminated and all money returned to the fans. On May 26, it was confirmed that the last three original members of RaNia - Di, T-ae and Xia had withdrawn from the group and parted ways from DR Music after five years. They then signed with their new label Enter Hama, where they announced their plans to redebute as \"Ela8te\", although these plans fell through. On June 26, RaNia performed at a Chinese event with three DR Music trainees: Jian, Jieun (a former member of LPG ) and Crystal. On August 15, 2016, Alex announced that she was the group's new leader. On October 25, RaNia performed with two DR Music trainees (Ttabo and Hyeonji) at the 2016 Seoul ICARUS Drone International Film Festival. Two days later DR Music stated that from seven DR Music trainees they would choose new RaNia members. On December 23, 2016, DR Music revealed a teaser image for \"BP RaNia\" (\"Black Pearl\" RaNia, in reference to Alex's darker skintone) and hinted a comeback as a seven-member group. On December 24, an image teaser for Hyeme and new member Jieun were revealed. On 25 December, Zi.U (formerly known as Seulji) and new member Yumin teaser images were revealed. On December 26, DR Music revealed teaser images for Alex and new Chinese member Ttabo. It was reported that former member Saem had rejoined the group after two years following her departure in late 2014, and that she had changed her stage name to Yina. On December 27, DR Music revealed last teaser image for Saem, confirming that she had re-joined the group. On December 28, RaNia released their first teaser music video for their upcoming comeback track \"Start a Fire\" as BP RaNia. \"Start a Fire\" was released on December 30, 2016, along with their fourth EP of the same name. DR Music said \"Through Spanish company INGENIOmedia, the song will be available in more than 60 countries around the world.\" On February 10 2017, DR Music announced that BP RaNia would start promotions for their second song \"Make Me Ah\" from the Start a Fire EP, on February 14. It was also announced that this would be the first time that Alex would take part in the entire choreography. On February 21, DR Music revealed that the company was approached by a well established production company with an acting opportunity for Alex, to which they responded by releasing a statement saying that they hoped that fans could understand the benefits of this opportunity, and that the opportunity would \"allow the group to gain exposure and help BP RaNia's success by expanding their fan base.\" DR Music assured the fans that Alex would remain a fully active member of BP RaNia, and would return to her regular schedules after her return to Korea. The company asked people to send positivity to Alex and to wait patiently and enthusiastically for their return. On February 28, RaNia released their first compilation album RaNia Legends , comprising songs from \"Dr Feel Good\" to \"Start a Fire\". On May 12, DR Music announced that they were looking for three to four new members to start BP RaNia W, a worldwide group that would promote alongside the current members of BP RaNia. Near the end of March fans noticed that Yina was absent from group promotions, to which DR Music replied that Yina was busy with her own individual activities. On June 8, Yina announced in an Instagram post that she was leaving BP RaNia. The agency later confirmed that Yina had decided to focus on her acting career. BP RaNia remained as a six-membered group, releasing their seventh EP Refresh 7th on August 12, with title track \"Beep Beep Beep\". Promotions became controversial when fans noticed that Alex had very few lines, and in fact spent the majority of performances standing off to the side while the other girls danced and sang. On August 19, DR Music announced that Alex had left the group, and that the group would continue promotions as five. Following her departure, Alex took to Twitter and criticized the company in regards to how she was treated and her departure, saying \"People think they can push you around, take advantage of you, manipulate you, violate you then throw you in the trash and walk. Dead wrong.\" On September 13, it was announced that the group would be making a comeback with \"Breathe Heavy\" from their Refresh 7th EP. In January 2018, after fans noticed that Ttabo had missed several appearances with the group, DR Music issued a statement stating she was filming a movie in China. On May 31, DR Music announced the departure of Yumin from the group due to her having \"recently been faced with circumstances that make it increasingly hard for her to follow the extremely demanding team schedule\". It was also announced that the group would be having a comeback in June and releasing a \"Best Of\" album in August, but neither event occurred. On June 28, it was announced that a new member named Namfon had joined the group. She made her first appearance on RaNia's Malaysia tour. On July 17, former member Yumin was announced to be marrying former Topp Dogg member P-Goon. In February 2019, Yumin revealed that following the birth of their son, she and P-Goon had separated, and she was raising the baby herself. On November 7, when asked via SNS by fans if she was still a member Ttabo stated that she is a \u201cformer idol\u201d, and following the discovery that every remaining member of the group had removed \"RaNia\" from their social media accounts and that the company had unfollowed some of the members, rumours began to circulate that DR Music as a company had gone bankrupt and was unable to continue operations, resulting in an unofficial disbandment. On August 18, 2019, RaNia announced via their official Instagram account that they would be performing in Romania from September 4\u20135 with three unconfirmed members. Fans began speculating that this meant Zi.U and Jieun had left the group. On August 28, the group's official YouTube account uploaded a video confirming the Romania performance as well as revealing the three new members as Seunghyun, Larissa, and ex- Stellar member Youngheun, as well as confirming departures of Jieun, Zi.U and Ttabo. On January 25, 2020, Namfon was announced to have left the group, bringing the group's total number of former members to 14. It was also revealed that the group has had no further activities since the performance in Romania. On February 18, Namfon spoke with a fansite and alleged that DR Music did not care about the group, and expressed her hopes that the other members would be able to leave as quickly as possible. In March, Larissa was revealed to have returned to her home country of Brazil, and fans noticed she had \"liked\" a fan comment on RaNia's official instagram that said the company \"should just let the group die in peace\", as well as liking several other comments with the same sentiment.

The group was composed of eleven members: Kim Yo-han , Kim Woo-seok , Han Seung-woo, Song Hyeong-jun, Cho Seung-youn , Son Dong-pyo, Lee Han-gyul, Nam Do-hyon, Cha Jun-ho, Kang Min-hee and Lee Eun-sang. The group debuted on August 27, 2019 with the single \"Flash\" under Swing Entertainment and was co-managed by Stone Music Entertainment . Despite a successful debut, X1's career was mired by the Mnet vote manipulation investigation , and after an unsuccessful negotiation about the group's future between the members' individual agencies, they disbanded on January 6, 2020. The group's name, X1, was suggested by netizens through the official Produce X 101 website and chosen by CJ E&M , with the name taken from the show's title song \"X1-MA\". X1 means \"11\" in Roman numbers, and also represents 10 members + 1 member who received the 'X' rank. [ citation needed ] On August 19, X1 released their fandom name, \"One It\". The name \"One It\" has two meanings: the first, \"want it\" like how the members wish to achieve their goals, and second, how their fans are the one thing most important to X1. X1 was formed through the survival competition series Produce X 101 , which aired on Mnet from May 3, 2019, until July 19, 2019. Out of an initial 101 trainees participating, the final 10 were chosen out of the remaining 20 trainees in the final week of the show. The final member, known as the rank X member, was selected from the remaining trainees based on the highest number of cumulative votes. All members were announced via the final episode, which was broadcast live on July 19, 2019. Prior to the program, many of the members have already been active in the music industry. Cho Seung-youn debuted as a member of Uniq in 2014. He also debuted as a solo artist and music producer under the stage name Luizy in 2016, before changing it to WOODZ in 2018. He is known for producing the Idol Producer debut evaluation song \"It's Ok\". Kim Woo-seok debuted in UP10TION under the name Wooshin in September 2015, in which he was also the host of SBS MTV 's The Show alongside Produce 101 season 1 contestant & former I.O.I member Jeon So-mi in 2016. Han Seung-woo debuted as a member and the leader of Victon in November 2016. Lee Han-gyul previously debuted as a member of Yama and Hotchicks Entertainment's ballad group IM and competed with his fellow IM members in KBS2 's The Unit where he ended up in 13th place. Fellow MBK trainee Nam Do-hyon was a contestant in MBC 's Under Nineteen as a member of the Rap Team and was ended up in 42nd place on the show. Their contract was intended for 5 years after debut, with a 2.5-year exclusive contract and another 2.5-year non-exclusive contract, meaning that the individual members can return to co-promote with their original agencies after the first half of their contract is over. After the program, the Top 11 contestants debuted under Stone Music 's Swing Entertainment , the label which housed the second season Produce 101 Season 2 winner Wanna One . However, following a civil lawsuit filed against Mnet due to Produce X 101' s vote manipulation allegations , several brands cancelled their endorsement deals with X1 or put them on hold. Some of the agencies of the contestants refused to sign until the allegations cleared up. In spite of this, X1's debut proceeded as planned. Ahead of debut, the group's reality show X1 Flash premiered on August 22, 2019 through Mnet. The reality show follows the members as they prepare for their debut, and gives a glimpse into their real lives. The group debuted on August 27, 2019 with a debut showcase at Gocheok Sky Dome . On August 1, it was announced that the debuting album is Emergency: Quantum Leap with title song \"Flash\", composed by Score, Megatone and Onestar (Monotree). On September 3, X1 won their first-ever music show win through SBS MTV 's The Show one week after debut. They received 11 wins in total for their debut song, \"Flash\" with their 11th win being on M Countdown on September 19. On November 5, 2019, Ahn Joon-young, the producer of Produce X 101 , was arrested, and he later admitted that all eleven members had been selected before the end of the show. This affected X1's image and caused several public appearances to be cancelled. Mnet announced that there were currently no plans for the group to promote. On December 30, 2019, CJ ENM announced that members and their agencies were in discussions on the group's future. On January 6, 2020, CJ ENM, Swing Entertainment, and the members' individual agencies held a meeting to determine the future of the group. After deliberating for an hour about whether the group should continue promoting or disband, a secret ballot was held by the members' agencies. The agencies agreed prior to voting that the group could only continue if there was unanimous agreement or else the group would disband. Four agencies voted to continue, four agencies voted to disband, and one agency whose vote was unclear was ultimately discarded. Thus, it was determined that the group would disband. Although X1 members were not invited to the meeting, Swing CEO Cho Yoo-myung expressed their collective desire to have attended. After the group's disbandment was decided, CJ ENM suggested that a previously recorded winter track be released as a goodbye song, but the idea was rejected by two or three of the members' agencies. Similarly, a suggestion from a member's agency to record a final video was rejected by another agency. Prior to debut, X1 made their Billboard chart debut on the charts Social 50 and Emerging Artists at No. 6 and No. 11, making them the first Korean artists to land a spot on the Social 50 prior to debut. X1 has sold over 500,000 physical copies of their EP in first week of sales, hence broke the record for having the highest first week sales for a debut album, which was a record that was previously set by solo artist, Kang Daniel with his debut album, Color On Me.\n"}

The group includes seven members from four SM boy groups: Taemin from Shinee , Baekhyun and Kai from Exo , Taeyong and Mark from NCT and Ten and Lucas from WayV . On October 4, 2019, the group debuted with their self-titled EP . All members of SuperM were assembled from existing boy groups under SM Entertainment . Taemin debuted as a member of Shinee in May 2008. Baekhyun and Kai debuted as members of Exo in April 2012. Taeyong , Ten , and Mark debuted as members of NCT in April 2016. Lucas debuted in January 2018 as a new member of NCT. Taeyong and Mark were later added to NCT's South Korea-based sub-unit, NCT 127 , in July 2016, while Ten and Lucas were added to NCT's China-based sub-unit, WayV , in January 2019. In 2019, before the official announcement of SuperM's debut, there had been rumors that SM Entertainment was planning to debut a \" K-pop Super Boy Band\". On August 7, 2019, Capitol Music Group chairman Steve Barnett and SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man officially announced the group as SuperM at Capitol Congress 2019. The \"M\" in SuperM stands for both Matrix and Master, with each member already an established star in their own bands. The teaser revealed the members of the group, with each having performance, vocal, and rap abilities. Lee described the group as \"the Avengers of K-pop,\" with the group focusing more on performance-based music. SM A&R executive and director Chris Lee stated that the group was in the works for around a year, and felt the analogy to the Avengers was apt because according to him, \"Each Avenger has their own group and Iron Man has his own movie and Thor has his own, but together, they have an even greater synergy, so like that the members will pursue their own careers and own groups but also join together with synergy - a positive one.\" Audiences and followers had mixed opinions on the project at first, with some fans enthusiastic for the band's debut following the release of the first teaser at Capitol Congress 2019, while others were concerned about SM Entertainment prioritizing their established groups, Exo members establishing solo careers before their mandatory military service , and the group debuting in the United States rather than starting with Korean promotions. Writing for MTV News , Caitlin Kelley opines that \"the biggest takeaway from the backlash is that it's not that easy to combine the powers of multiple fandoms,\" and felt that the group's structure might be complicated for American audiences, although she noted that \"the fact that SuperM trended worldwide for several hours shows potential. That level of engagement means that there is widespread interest in the group \u2014 now it's just a matter of turning public opinion around.\" Kate Halliwell of The Ringer wrote, \"plenty of people support several groups within the K-pop genre at large, and it makes sense to target them whenever possible...but the toxic side of fandom is difficult to escape.\" She adds that the formation of the group \"once again [proves] how online backlash is inevitable, and often overwhelming, when it comes to navigating multiple K-pop fandoms at once,\" although she felt that the formation of the group \"[signifies] a rising tide in Western K-pop demand.\" SuperM promoted their debut album both in the United States and in South Korea. Several teasers for the group were posted in SuperM's various social media channels. The group filmed their debut music video in Dubai in August 2019. The group's self-titled debut EP was released on October 4, with the instrumental of one of the album's songs, \"I Can't Stand the Rain\", released on August 28. SuperM' s lead single, \"Jopping\", was released alongside its music video on the same day as the EP. The EP debuted at number one at the Billboard 200 albums chart, with 168,000 equivalent album units in the week ending October 10. SuperM had their debut concert at the Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles on October 5, and made their television debut on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on October 9. The group is currently embarking on their first tour, We Are the Future Live, with ten dates in North America from November 2019 to February 2020. The tour was extended to Latin America and Europe, with three tour dates in February 2020. SuperM were announced as global ambassadors for Korean Air in November 2019. On November 4, the group was featured alongside SM labelmate BoA in Korean Air's safety video, which was added to all Korean Air flights on the same day. The song featured in the video, \"Let's Go Everywhere,\" was released on November 18, and proceeds of the song will be donated to Global Poverty Project 's Global Citizen campaign. SuperM: We Are the Future Live is SuperM's first world tour to promote their eponymous debut album. The tour was officially announced on October 2, 2019 with tickets going on sale on October 5, 2019.

Prior to its debut with J&Star, the band had long been a popular indie group before making its official mainstream release with \"Sorry\" on August 3, 2017. Dojoon and Jaehyeong met as the two were busking in Hongdae.

By the end of 2015, Jaehyeong recruited Dojoon, who had left his company and returned to busking. The trio started the indie band Windfall and began to write their own music, while posting musical covers on YouTube and performing in the streets. When the band decided to search for their fourth and final member, Dojoon worked to recruit Woosung, who he had met through a mutual friend. In 2016, the band entered J&Star Company. On August 3, 2017, the band debuted its mainstream single, \"Sorry\", penned by Hajoon [ citation needed ] and under a new name, The Rose. Later that month, the Rolling Stone India lauded The Rose's single for being \"a fantastic introduction to the band\u2019s soft-rock vibe\" and described \"Woosung\u2019s immense control over his raspy vocals... particularly impressive.\" The group then made a subsequent comeback on October 31 with its second single, \"Like We Used To.\" On December 14, Billboard named The Rose's \"Sorry\" as one of the best Korean pop songs of 2017.

The Rose cited J&Star's pledge to provide them with monthly revenue reports which never materialized, as well as the company's unilateral decision to plan a 17-city American tour spanning 32 days, which would have required a concert every other day. J&Star Company denied the accusations and plan to \"take all necessary legal measures\".

In 2019 The Barberettes and Sweet Sorrow form a harmony collab group SBSB ( Korean : \uc2a4\ubc14\uc2a4\ubc14 ). The group started singing, as a trio, for fun in October 2012, when Wheeler had the idea of creating a retro-inspired girl group. Wheeler and Grace Kim were already singing solo for the same jazz band , and Park began taking vocal lessons from Wheeler. They performed at a number of places, including the indie music venues in the Hongdae area near Hongik University in Seoul, and for audiences of the older Korean generation, releasing their first album on May 27, 2014. The name \"Barberettes\" was chosen because they wanted to name themselves after the a cappella barbershop music style, hoping to use a name like \"Barbershop Quartet\", but lacking a fourth member, they added the suffix \"ettes\", like many girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s. They often use one microphone for performances, initially to imitate that era's girl groups, but later realizing the advantage when they found they could hear each other better, which helped them control the harmony balance. They also use costumes, make-up and choreography to re-create the effect. They described their music as \"Korean doo-wop done in the 21st century\". They were inspired by doo-wop, Motown , barbershop, and pop music that was created prior to the 1960s, and also by groups like The Andrews Sisters , The Chordettes , and The Ronettes , to whom they have been compared. They gave credit to the 1960s Korean girl group Korean Kittens, and especially The Kim Sisters , whom they discovered on YouTube , as having a large effect on them, and call them their \"biggest idols\". They said they were stunned by the performances of the Kim Sisters, who did not receive a lot of recognition in Korea until recently, but were signed with Motown, and performed on The Ed Sullivan Show many times. Because of the group's performances in indie venues they are often referred to as an indie pop group. Their musical style has been described as \"giving a glimpse into what K-pop might have been like in the 1950s with their styling and song choice\". Shinae An Wheeler, the group's creator, producer, leader, guitarist , main composer and writer was born July 30, 1986 in Seongnam . She graduated from the Seoul Institute of the Arts and started her professional music career at age fifteen as a backing vocalist for some of the S.M.

She teaches at Kwangwoon Conservatory of Music and has taught free music classes and worked with charities for disadvantaged teenagers in Seoul. As one of the group's vocalists, she trades out vocal harmonies with the other two members, sometimes singing lead. Grace (Eun Hye, in Korean) Kim, was born on April 11, 1987 in Seoul. She trained on classical piano , violin and flute , and from 2011-2014 studied at Chung-Ang University . She was active in the indie-jazz scene as a lead vocalist in a 12-piece Korean jazz band called JHG (Just Hip'n Groovy), whose band leader was Jung Jung Hwa, a professor of Seoul Institute of the Arts. She was the group's vocalist usually singing the higher notes in the harmonies, and said of herself, \"I am the playful one with a big smile.\" So Hee Park was born on April 10, 1991 in Suwon She played piano since a very young age and started studying modern contemporary music in 2011 at Sungshin Women's University .

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Milk", "name": "Crayon Pop", "labels": ["Chrome Entertainment", "Sony Music", "Pony Canyon"], "intro": " Crayon Pop ( Hangul : \ud06c\ub808\uc6a9\ud31d) is a South Korean girl group formed under Chrome Entertainment in 2012. The group consists of four members: Geummi, Ellin, Choa, and Way. Their fifth member, Soyul, left the group in 2017. Crayon Pop officially debuted in July 2012 with their performance of \"Saturday Night\" on Mnet 's M! Countdown . Their first EP was not a commercial success, and when their song \"Dancing Queen\" was released in October, the group had few opportunities to promote on music shows . Instead they held guerrilla performances on the streets of Seoul, which helped increase their fanbase. Crayon Pop gained a huge increase in popularity following the release of their single album \" Bar Bar Bar \" in June 2013. The group's unique stage outfits and choreography gained public attention, and made the title song a viral hit. It eventually managed to reach number 1 on Billboard 's K-Pop Hot 100 . Crayon Pop was able to earn numerous awards, including the New Rising Star Award at the Golden Disk Awards , the Hot Trend Award at the MelOn Music Awards , and Best New Female Artist at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . The group has held solo concerts in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, and has also performed in other countries including Australia and China. Throughout June and July 2014, the group was an opening act Lady Gaga 's ArtRave: The Artpop Ball concert tour. Crayon Pop performed for it in 12 cities around the United States and Canada. Following their appearance in the Artpop tour, the group debuted their first subunit in October. The unit is named Strawberry Milk, and consists of the twin members Choa and Way. In March 2015, Crayon Pop released their second mini album FM , for which they used Super Sentai inspired costumes. They released the song \"RaRiRuRe\" in June of that same year, which was their debut in the Japanese music market. The group continued their Japanese promotions with their second single \"Dancing All Night\" in November. Their first Japanese studio album Crayon Pop was released January 2016, and it ranked #11 on Oricon's Daily Album Charts . Crayon Pop collaborated with Mexican boy band CD9 in August, to release the song \"Get Dumb\". In September, Crayon Pop released the song \"Vroom Vroom\" ahead of their first album Crayon Pop Evolution Pop Vol. 1 . They soon released the music video for \"Doo Doom Chit\", another song that would feature on the track list of the album. On 19 April 2017, the group announced their contracts with Chrome Media had ended in March and they had gone their separate ways, although they would not be officially disbanding. On 30 May, it was revealed that Way, Choa, Geummi and Ellin would continue to promote as Crayon Pop under Chrome Entertainment, but Soyul had chosen to leave the group. The group was initially named Hurricane Pop, and consisted of members Serang (Yang Se-hyeon), Geummi (Baek Bo-ram), Ellin (Kim Min-young), Choa (Heo Min-jin), and Soyul (Park Hye-kyeong). Chrome Entertainment's CEO, Hwang Hyun-chang, did not consider candidates who were taller than 165\u00a0cm or had a sexy image, because he wanted a group of ordinary girls. Soyul was the first member to be accepted, and Geummi was the next to join. Serang, under the name Mari, had formerly been the leader of the disbanded girl group Coin Jackson. Ellin was referred to Chrome Entertainment by Chrome's dance choreographer and was accepted after her third audition. Choa was recommended to the company by Way, her twin sister. Way had been invited to audition, but was unable to do so because she was a member of the indie band N.Dolphin. Singer Bumkey was involved in the audition process and also supervised the group's vocal training. The group recorded their first song 'Bing Bing' as Hurricane Pop. In January 2012, they performed the song live for the first time in Hangzhou , China. The performance of 'Bing Bing' was filmed for the Chinese television drama Curry Campus . A music video for their song was filmed in February, but Serang left the group in May to pursue an acting career. After Serang's departure, Way was given another chance to join the group and she left N.Dolphin. Shortly before their debut the group's name was changed to Crayon Pop, as Chrome Entertainment thought the name Hurricane Pop would be insensitive in light of Japan's tsunamis . The members' stage names were chosen by the company's CEO, although several of them had input into the choice. Crayon Pop began their promotions in Japan in May 2012, using their time there to film music videos for \"Bing Bing\". The group released both the Korean and Japanese music videos in June. The music video for their debut single \"Saturday Night\" was released on 17 July, followed by a Japanese version, as well as an alternate version with new footage, on 24 July. Crayon Pop's first EP , Crayon Pop 1st Mini Album , was released digitally on 18 July and included both \"Bing Bing\" and \"Saturday Night\". The group made their official stage debut the following day on 19 July, performing \"Saturday Night\" on Mnet 's M! Countdown . Crayon Pop's debut did not receive much attention and their album was not commercially successful. Chrome Entertainment's CEO later revealed that the album had depleted all the company's money. Crayon Pop released a digital single album, \"Dancing Queen\", on 24 October 2012. Besides the title track, it also included a remixed version of \"Bing Bing\". In order to stand out from other girl groups, Crayon Pop wore tracksuits instead of more feminine clothing. After seeing a performance of \"Dancing Queen\", Kangin and Shindong of Super Junior praised the song and group, with Shindong saying \"I'd love to produce a girl group like them\". Crayon Pop was only invited to perform on music shows three times, and they were not able to have a typical promotion cycle. As a result, they took to the streets and promoted \"Dancing Queen\" with guerrilla performances, which often took place in extremely cold weather. Chrome Entertainment also produced a reality web series about the group, titled Crayon Pop TV . Through these activities, Crayon Pop developed a loyal fanbase, especially of \"uncle fans\" called \"Pop-jeossi\" (from the Korean word ajeossi ). Crayon Pop returned to Japan and held a mini-concert on 6 January 2013 in Shibuya, Tokyo . Tickets went on sale on 11 December 2012, and sold out in less than an hour. As a result of considerable demand from fans unable to purchase tickets, Chrome Entertainment announced that another Japanese concert would be held at a later date, and a second mini-concert was staged in Osaka on 22 February. On 25 January, Crayon Pop began promoting the remixed version of \"Bing Bing\", which included a popping dance break to Daft Punk 's \" Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger \" instead of the original rap verse. They had a \"delinquent schoolgirl\" concept with new choreography, and wore tracksuits or school uniforms with tracksuit pants. On 19 May, a third Japanese mini-concert was held in Shibuya, Tokyo. A new Japanese member, Arisa, was to be revealed at this concert, but she had withdrawn from the group before the performance. On 8 June, Crayon Pop performed a preview version of their new song \" Bar Bar Bar \". The unusual dance featured choreographed jumping, and they wore scooter helmets, polo shirts, and tracksuit pants with skirts. A story version music video was released on 13 June, a week before the song's digital release on 20 June. Three days later, a dance version music video was released. Filmed with a budget of only 380,000 won (US$347), the music video went viral and Crayon Pop drew interest due to their unique stage outfits and choreography. This music video has more than 51 million views on YouTube as of April 2019. As \"Bar Bar Bar\" went viral, it began to climb the Korean digital music charts, eventually reaching the upper positions of most major real time chart listings. It stayed at the top of Billboard 's Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart for more than a month, and ranked number 1 for the first time eight weeks after release. \"Bar Bar Bar\" solidified its viral status when a parody video was aired on a segment of SNL Korea on 13 August. That same day, it was announced that Crayon Pop had signed a contract with Sony Music Entertainment , who were inspired by the groups' creativity and uniqueness and saw their global market potential. Crayon Pop scored their first music show win when \"Bar Bar Bar\" won first place on Music Bank on 30 August, beating EXO 's \" Growl \". On 9 September, a \"Global Version\" music video was released ahead of Crayon Pop's second mini album, The Streets Go Disco , which was released on 26 September under the Sony Music label. This album consisted of their four previous singles and remixes of those songs. A music video for the title track, \"Dancing Queen 2.0\", was released along with the album. \"Bar Bar Bar\" earned Chrome Entertainment US$2 million in the year after its release, and Crayon Pop was able to move from their small row house in Nonhyeon-dong to a luxury \"villa\" apartment due to their increased income. Crayon Pop's rising popularity also brought them criticism. Netizens accused the group of being affiliated with the right-wing website Ilbe after Way used the phrase nomu nomu (\ub178\ubb34\ub178\ubb34) on Twitter. This phrase was popularized on Ilbe and was used to criticize former president Roh Moo-hyun . It was then discovered that Chrome Entertainment's CEO previously mentioned the website on Twitter. CEO Hwang responded by saying he was registered on many popular online communities, including Ilbe, in order to gather information about singers and girl groups. He also stated that Way's phrase was an example of aegyo and she was not even aware of the website. However, the controversy continued and several of the group's scheduled events were cancelled after criticism from the public. Online auction company Auction stopped broadcasting its new TV commercial featuring Crayon Pop after widespread customer complaints. The controversy resurfaced in January 2014 after Ellin allegedly used the Ilbe hand sign, but Chrome Entertainment explained that Ellin was forming the letter \"E\" with her hand, and all the Crayon Pop members have alphabet hand signs that signify their names. Due to Crayon Pop's increased popularity, they had more opportunities to perform. On 27 July, they held their first mini-concert in South Korea.

After the release of \"Bar Bar Bar\", Corynn Smith of MTV called Crayon Pop \"a disco-pop K-Pop group that is obviously having a blast\" with \"bafflingly simple lyrics and unexpected choreography.\" Pops in Seoul described \" Lonely Christmas \" as \"a dance song with funk and disco sounds\", while Billboard magazine noted the song's catchy hook and energetic synths, trumpets and guitars. Crayon Pop's sixth single, \"Uh-ee\", is a mix of electronic sounds and trot . Chrome Entertainment called the genre \" house electronic trot\" because it \"is composed of fast beats and strong electronic sounds with addictive trot melody\". Billboard described the song as having a hyper- techno dance beat that would fit into Dance Dance Revolution , while the dance routine was \"more like an intense aerobic workout than a silly dance\". Strawberry Milk ( Korean : \ub538\uae30 \uc6b0\uc720 ; RR : Ttalgiuyu ) is Crayon Pop's first subgroup, featuring twins Choa and Way. Chrome Entertainment announced the subgroup (also called a unit or sub-unit) on 29 September 2014. Their debut album, The 1st Mini Album , was released on 15 October, along with a music video for the title track, \"OK\". Another song on the album, \"Let Me Know\", was written by Way.

In April 2015, Choa and Way were featured on Kim Yoo-min's \"Road\" (\uae38), the lead single from his debut mini album (released under the stage name, Bear Planet). The sisters also played two of the lead roles in the music video. On 13 January 2016, the sisters released the single \"I Hate You\" (\ub098\uac00 \ubbf8\uc6cc).

To promote The ReVe Festival trilogy, the group embarked on their third tour, La Rouge, which began in Seoul on November 23 and 24. Red Velvet plays on what they call their \"red\" and \"velvet\" sides, which influences both their image and the music they release. The \"red\" half is their brighter and bubblier side while their \"velvet\" image is their softer, more mature and elegant concept. The 'red' half of the group's music is predominantly of the pop genre while the 'velvet' is primarily R&B and ballads , with the group often mixing it with various genres. Red Velvet's dual image also affects the members' styling . For their \"red\" concept, they are usually dressed in colorful, girlish clothing, such as the pastel sweaters and skirts from \"Ice Cream Cake\" or the red doll outfits from \"Dumb Dumb\". They are dressed more maturely for their \"velvet\" side, most notably, when they wore suits for \"Be Natural\". Red Velvet has been lauded for breaking stereotypes among popular girl groups in South Korea whose concepts tend to fall under two categories which are \"cute or pure\" and \"sexy\", often to fulfill a certain fantasy. In a country where girl groups' fanbases are typically mostly male, according to Taylor Glasby of Dazed Digital , the majority of Red Velvet's fans are young women. IZE Magazine named the group as one of the successful female figures who helped transform the \"passive image\" of South Korean women. Billboard reported in December 2018 that Red Velvet was the overall favorite k-pop group of the year among every gender and sexual identity on the popular internet forum Reddit . In February 2018, Time magazine named Red Velvet as one of the best K-pop groups, highlighting their versatile musical styles. Red Velvet was also recognized for their brand recognition and marketing power, having topped the 'Girl Group Brand Power Ranking' published by the Korean Corporate Reputation Research Institute for three consecutive months. In November 2019, Billboard has crowned Red Velvet as \"the best idol group alive\" and has named \" Red Flavor \" as the second-best K-pop song of the 2010s. Red Velvet performed in Pyongyang on April 1, 2018. This made them the seventh idol group to ever perform in North Korea. They performed \" Red Flavor \" and \"Bad Boy\" at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre to an audience including Kim Jong-un . The concert was billed as \"Spring is Coming\" and is part of a wider diplomatic initiative between South Korea and North Korea. In October of the same year, South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism awarded the group the 'Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism's Commendation' for their contributions in raising awareness of the country's popular culture and arts. The director of the Korea Foundation for International Cultural Exchange while discussing the Korean Wave in 2018 cited Red Velvet as a major contributor and one of the country's most talented idol groups who have \"largely promoted K-pop\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJCC", "name": "JJCC", "labels": ["Jackie Chan Group Korea", "Teichiku Records (Japan)"], "intro": "JJCC (pronounced J-J-C-C; Hangul : \uc81c\uc774\uc81c\uc774\uc528\uc528) is a six-member South Korean hip hop boy band formed under the management of Jackie Chan Group Korea. The group debuted on March 20, 2014 with five members: E.co, Eddy, SimBa, San-Cheong and Prince Mak who performed live on MNet M Countdown. Their debut single entitled At First was then released on March 24. JJCC is the first K-pop idol group to be formed by Jackie Chan . The name of the band is composed of the man who forms the group and the group's aim. The first \"JC\" comes from the first letters of the words Jackie and Chan while the second \"JC\" comes from the first letters of the words join and cultures . When combined together, it is literally \"Jackie Chan Joint Cultures\" (JJCC) translated to \"Jackie Chan, let's spread K-Pop\". In the same way, the pronunciation of the group name (Double-JC) stands for \"Double Joy Creative\" or \"Let's create double the joy\". The band name is a tribute to Chan as well as his effort to \"join cultures\" in Asia through music. Jackie Chan is a long-time fan of K-Pop. After seeing Kpop's great potential and development, he started to form a Kpop group and even personally manages them. JJCC's aim is for the world to be conquered once Asian culture unites through their different music and charm. In preparation for this, the members of JJCC received individual training on their personality and stunts as well as improving their singing, dancing, rapping, songwriting, and acting skills. Their dance skills include popping, b-boying, and even ballet. They are also able to speak in three languages- English, Chinese, and Korean. Together with Chan, veteran K-Pop producer-composer Choi Jun-Young is serving as the executive producer of the group while Sha-Sha Lee is the CEO of the newly formed Jackie Chan Group South Korea establishment. The group is composed of five Koreans (E.Co, Yul, Zica, SimBa, San-Cheong), one Korean American (Eddy) and one inactive Chinese Australian (Prince Mak). Eddy competed on the cooking challenge show \" Master Chef Korea \" once, and is known for his cooking skills. Members SimBa and Eco are also models. Although K-Pop is still rare on the Western mainstream, the group already attracted the American media prior to their debut mainly because of Jackie Chan . They were included in major news outlets such as the New York Post and even appeared in traditional papers. Jackie Chan's presence gave JJCC a possibility for the Korean wave to enter the American mainstream. On March 13, 2014, JJCC released their first teaser which was posted on their YouTube account, \"Double JC\". During this time, little is still known about the group except the revelation of the members and Jackie Chan as the producer-manager. One week after, on March 20, 2014, JJCC was first seen live on Mnet's M! Countdown , performing \"At First\" (\"Everyone Is Like This At First\"), which was also their official debut date. It was followed by Music Bank and Inkigayo . Finally on March 24, JJCC released their debut single as well as its music video. The song combines a melancholy hip-hop beat and a bit of R&B track. Prince Mak is not included in the music video as it is reported that he injured himself before the filming. Together with Kim Hee Sun and EXO , JJCC are performing on Chan's charity event entitled \"2014 Peace, Love and Friendship\" on April 6 in Beijing. The event, organized by Jaycee Chan , will have celebrities from all over the world and will include a concert, a fan meeting, launching event for \u2018Jackie Chan Film Hall\u2019 in Shanghai and more. The youngest member of the group (Maknae) San-Cheong played a small role in the Korean drama \" Madame Antoine \" which aired in January 2016. Before the group began their Japanese promotions, there was a lot of confusion over Prince Mak's status amongst them. With JJCC's Japanese company and official Facebook page updating JJCC's bio to state that JJCC had six members, many assumed he had left the group. However, Prince Mak personally stated that he is still a member of JJCC, but is currently working on solo activities, although sources such as JJCC's official websites have stated otherwise. Since then Prince has signed to Emperor Entertainment Group Beijing for his acting activities, and JJCC has continued as a sextet. On the SBS PopAsia radio show 'The Prince Mak Hour', Prince Mak answered a fan's question about his status within JJCC. He stated that while he is not signed to JJCC's Korean agency, he still considers himself to be a JJCC member. JJCC will be going on tour in the USA from August 6\u201312. San-Cheong and Yul participated in Produce 101 Season 2 . Both members were eliminated in episode 5.\n"}

After several years of appearing on each other's solo materials, the duo officially released the single \" Good Boy \" in 2014, which went on to top Billboard ' s World Digital Songs chart and sold over a million digital units in South Korea. Kwon Ji-yong and Dong Young-bae first met as trainees at YG Entertainment. After signing a contract with the record label, they spent the first year cleaning the studio and fetching water bottles during dance practices for YG artists. Dong later admitted that current artists at the time weren't friendly towards him or Kwon. The original plan for the two was to debut as the hip-hop duo GDYB, with Kwon choosing the stage name G-Dragon (\"Ji\" is pronounced like \"G\" and Yong is Korean for \"dragon\"). Though they made several appearances both as a duo and as individuals on other artists' music, the plan for their debut was scrapped and they were joined by four other trainees ( T.O.P , Daesung , Seungri and Jang Hyun-seung ) to form Big Bang instead. The formation of the group was documented on television, but prior to their official debut, Jang was dropped. Dong later adopted the stage name Taeyang. Member Seungri later admitted that G-Dragon was initially cold towards Daesung and himself because G-Dragon had wanted to be in the hip hop duo and disliked being placed in a band. Taeyang himself was also initially hesitant about being placed in a band but eventually warmed up to the other members. Despite activities with their band, the duo continued to collaborate with one another outside of Big Bang's materials, with G-Dragon participating as a writer and producer for Taeyang's first extended play Hot (2008), [nb 1] after which G-Dragon subsequently recorded a \"Part Two\" to the EP's lead single \"Only Look at Me\" (Korean: \ub098\ub9cc\ubc14\ub77c\ubd10; Revised Romanization: Naman Barabwa ).

Ladies' Code signed their first deal with Pepsi Korea in August 2013 as the company's next models for their 'Open Your Pepsi Now' campaign. In January 2014, the group teamed up with Nexon to promote the winter update for the MMORPG Mabinogi Heroes . Prior to the crash, Ladies' Code's music had been predominantly pop with a retro sound. Billboard magazine noted that the group blends in \"modern electro-pop \" with \"classic throwback elements\" and powerful vocals. The group's debut single \"Bad Girl\" was described as a swing/jazz-inspired track accompanied with solid vocals. Their follow-up single, \" Hate You \" was marked as a departure, returning with a mid-tempo dance song with a combination of brass and acoustic guitar arrangements. Subsequent releases retain their earlier style with Corynn Smith of MTV Iggy explaining their second extended play's title track \"Pretty Pretty\" as another example of the group's \"rich retro sound\", moving from 40s swing to a mixture of 70s and 80s beats. In an interview with enews on their digital single \" So Wonderful \", member Ashley explained the song was a continuation of their previous releases but added that they had incorporated the use of more instruments and were going for a \"retro feeling from the 80's.\" Their first release after the crash, Myst3ry , shifted into an R&B sound with the lead single \"Galaxy\" described as a \"mid-tempo song that invokes a gloomy and dreamlike mood\". Ladies' Code have cited the Brown Eyed Girls and Wonder Girls as their role models, the latter compared to the group by media outlets due to their similar style of music and image. In September 2013, Wonder Girls' member Sunye posted a message on Twitter supporting the group, saying how \"Pretty Pretty\" reminded her on their group's past releases \" Tell Me \" and \" So Hot \".

They released their debut single \"Beatles\" on April 3, 2013. The group originally debuted with a \"boyish\" concept, referring to the fact that the majority of the members had short hair and a more masculine attitude and style, opposed to the feminine concepts many Korean pop girl groups have, but after their line-up changes, the group returned in 2015 with a feminine and sexy concept. The group was announced on March 20, 2013, and image teasers were released revealing the members of the group. It was revealed that they would take on a fresh concept from that of the usual girl group: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} Following this, a music video teaser revealed the rappers, OneKet and AI, followed by a video for singers Eunji, Hayun and Aram, and a full group music video teaser. The group released their debut single \"Beatles\" on April 3, 2013 along with its music video. They made their debut on Show Champion the same day. On July 1, 2013, Sim Tong Entertainment released album jacket photos for their upcoming 2nd digital single, \"Because of You\". \"Because of You\" was supposed to be released on the 3rd of July (with the release of Global Icon's first mini album to be later on in August), but the single was delayed to August 30 due to scheduling issues, and the mini album to September 3. The group was also chosen to become models for \"94Street\", a Korean restaurant. This drew some criticism from fans, as the CF features the members dressed in fancy dresses, something which many took to mean that the group was straying from their original \"boyish\" concept. [ citation needed ] The group announced that they would be returning in October of that year with the song \"Don't Lie\", but the song was deemed \"unfit for terrestrial broadcast\" by all the major networks, and they were forced to go with \"Giyeuk\" as their comeback single instead. On June 25, 2014, it was announced by GI International Fanclub that Aram had decided to leave the group. This came after around two months of silence from Aram's social media accounts, right after coming back from promotion in Japan. Representative of SimTong Entertainment initially said to GI International Fanclub that \"Aram's withdrawal from GI and our agency is under discussion\", but then revealed that \"GI will stay as a 5 member group and instead of Aram, a new member will be added in her place.\" It was also announced that GI was preparing for a comeback with the new member, and she would more than likely be taking over Aram's position as main vocalist. Member Hayun uploaded a photo on Twitter on June 19 showing the girls practicing, including a shot of two unknown girls, who fans presumed to be the new members, although they were met with strong criticism when fans noticed that they were lip-syncing during live performances. On November 14, 2014 it was revealed through the group's official page that Hayun had also left the group (in August of that year), leaving the group's future in doubt, although it was announced in January 2015 that the group would be making a comeback in that year. On February 24, 2015, AlphaBat 's Delta made a post on his Instagram account declaring that G.I. would release their third single on February 25. The next day, G.I. member OneKet was revealed to have filed a contract termination lawsuit against Simtong Entertainment citing poor management, and Simtong responded with the claim that OneKet and Aram had breached their contracts. On June 29, SimTong Entertainment dropped individual videos for introducing the three new members: Do Kyung, Ji A-min & Hee So. The group made their comeback with the new lineup on September 2, surprising fans due to their abrupt change from the \"tomboyish\" concept that the group were known and praised for to a far more feminine concept for their 'Doligo Doligo' MV. Neither the music video nor the song were well received, with reviewers saying the imagery of the video was \"risible, inappropriate [and] tasteless\". On March 28, Eunji announced her departure from the group via a tweet that said: \"Everyone who loved and supporting GI, thank you so much, sincerely... I was so happy. I'll come back with a new look. Goodbye for just a little.\" At the same time, Dokyung deleted all her tweets, leading to speculation that the group had disbanded. In May 2016, Heeso redebuted in the girl group AGirls. The group unofficially disbanded soon after, and in August 2016, she joined HEXE for their \"Fallin' Fallin'\" comeback under the stage name \"Jin\".

It consists of five male members: Yoo Il , Seo Kang-joon , Gong Myung , Kang Tae-oh and Lee Tae-hwan . The group members were selected through Fantagio's \"Actor\u2032s League,\" a program for discovering aspiring actors, and were trained for two years before making their entertainment debut. Unlike idol groups which begin their careers as singers and later expand their endeavors to acting, 5urprise did the opposite. As their first project, they made their acting debut in After School: Lucky or Not , a 12-episode mobile drama with each episode lasting 15 minutes, and viewed through Nate Hoppin, BTV , and T-Store on smartphones and tablet computers . They played five members of a high school club who encounter an outcast (played by actress Kim So-eun ) and as they complete \"missions,\" they build a friendship with each other and coax the shy girl out of her shell. 5urprise released the single \"Hey U Come On\" for the mobile drama's soundtrack . Pre-debut, members of the group also appeared in music videos of female pop group Hello Venus . 5urprise released their first single in 2014, titled From My Heart . "}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2Yoon", "name": "2Yoon", "labels": ["Cube"], "intro": " 2Yoon ( Hangul : \ud22c\uc724, commonly stylized as 2YOON ) was the first and only sub-group of South Korean girl group 4Minute , formed by Cube Entertainment in 2013. The sub-group consisted of Gayoon and Jiyoon . Gayoon and Jiyoon were the lead singers of 4Minute. Cube Entertainment CEO Hong Seung Sung wanted to pair them in a sub-group after watching the duo perform live at the 2011 United Cube in London. The duo were known to fans collectively as Ssangyoon (Hangul: \uc30d\uc724) (a portmanteau of the Hangul word for \"twins\" and the last characters of their given name \"yoon\"). However, as the pronunciation of \"Ssangyoon\" involves a tensed consonant , it was deemed to be ill-fitting for the group's cute image. As such, the sub-unit was renamed as 2Yoon. In addition, \"ssangyoon\" could be potentially misheard as a profanity, further supporting the basis for the name change. 2Yoon appeared on MBC 's Weekly Idol as Ssangyoon, since the show was recorded before the official name change. On January 7, 2013, Cube Entertainment announced that the 2Yoon debut album, Harvest Moon , was slated for a mid-January release, with \" 24/7 \" confirmed as the title track. On January 22, 2013, 2YOON released its album and accompanying music video for \"24/7.\" 2Yoon made its television debut on M! Countdown on January 18, 2013. 2Yoon's members revealed through an interview that they felt motivated and encouraged by Girls' Generation members after a listening session. Gayoon, through another interview, also revealed she lost weight rehearsing to the song's choreography. Due to their innovative efforts, Time Magazine showed interest in 2Yoon's music and observed Korea's potential in the world's music scene. 2Yoon became the first Korean girl group to be interviewed by Time. In the interview with TIME, the members cited that they listened to artists like Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and that they were used as inspiration to the recording sessions. Marc Hogan of Spin called 2Yoon's \"24/7\" music video \"as giddily irresistible as you'd hope\", commending the pair for incorporating elements of country music without losing the \"characteristically hyper-melodic, electronica\"-ness of K-pop. Lily Rothman of Time lauded 2Yoon for attempting the \"unlikely union\" of country music and K-pop, showing the symbiotic influence that both American-music and K-pop exert on each other. Park Hyun-min of Mnet praised the \"light and joyous\" execution of the lead single. \"24/7\" received polarized reviews, some praising its innovative attempt into bringing country music to Korean pop, while others criticized such aspects as its melody, lyrics, rap style and technique, claiming the song as an experimental failure. 2Yoon has been praised by both foreign and domestic music magazines for being the first K-Pop act to release a country-inspired track. 2Yoon became the first sub-unit of a Korean music group to be promoted in Thailand, performing and giving interviews.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2Eyes", "name": "2Eyes", "labels": ["SidusHQ", "/", "LOEN Entertainment"], "intro": "2Eyes ( Korean : \ud22c\uc544\uc774\uc988 ), stylized as 2EYES , is a South Korean girl group formed by SidusHQ . They made their debut in 2013 as a five-member group and consisted of Hyangsuk, Hyerin, Dasom, Daeun and Yeonjun. Following Yeonjun's departure, the group continues to promote as a four-member group. 2Eyes was formed by SidusHQ with Hyun Jin-young as their producer. It was SidusHQ's first investment into a K-pop group since the short-lived girl group LUV and the highly successful first-generation boy band g.o.d . Prior to receiving their current name, the group was called \"god5\" (\uac13\ud30c\uc774\ube0c) as they were modeled after the five-member g.o.d. Hyangsuk and Dasom had both competed in the jTBC talent competition Made in U ( ko ) before joining SidusHQ. Hyerin was a former JYP Entertainment trainee. Daeun had been a dancer. Yeonjun, the youngest member, was the final member recruited and had been part of an unsuccessful duo called Spiel (\uc2a4\ud53c\ub12c\ub85c) before joining the KBS singing competition program The Last Audition of My Life ( ko ) where she was scouted by SidusHQ. Prior to their official debut, 2Eyes recorded their version of \"Winter Love\" (\uaca8\uc6b8\uc0ac\ub791), one of the soundtracks of the critically acclaimed SBS drama That Winter, the Wind Blows . It was released in May 2013. The group name was derived from the idea of the members communicating with the audience through their eyes. They then made their debut on June 20, 2013, performing their single \"Don't Mess With Me\" (\uae4c\ubd88\uc9c0\ub9c8) on the Mnet music program M Countdown . The single album and music video for \"Don't Mess With Me\" were released in July. The music video featured fellow SidusHQ artist, actor Kim Woo-bin . Their debut drew much attention from critics as their management agency SidusHQ was better known for managing some of South Korea's top actors and actresses rather than musicians. After Yeonjun's departure, 2Eyes decided to continue promoting as a four-member group. They made their comeback on August 24, 2015 with the single \"PIPPI\", which is based on the children's stories character Pippi Longstocking . The music video featured all for members dressed like Pippi Longstocking before transforming into beautiful young women. In September, their company SidusHQ received a complaint from the Swedish company Saltkr\u00e5kan which owned the copyright to the character Pippi Longstocking over the group's use of the concept without permission. When they debuted, 2Eyes opted for strong feminine and sexy image. Unlike many girl groups who debuted at the time with bubblegum pop and \" cute \" concepts, 2Eyes drew attention for doing the opposite and debuting with a more mature image. "}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS_(band)", "name": "BTS", "labels": ["Big Hit", "Pony Canyon", "Def Jam Japan", "[1]", "Columbia", "[2]"], "intro": " BTS ( Korean : \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 ; RR : Bangtan Sonyeondan ), also known as the Bangtan Boys , is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2010. The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group have staged several world tours. The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single \" Mic Drop \". The band is the first Korean act to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums Love Yourself: Answer (2018), Map of the Soul: Persona (2019) and Map of the Soul: 7 (2020), making BTS the fastest group since the Beatles to earn four number one albums in less than two years. Love Yourself: Answer also broke South Korea's Gaon Album Chart 's all-time monthly record previously set by Love Yourself: Tear and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States. Having sold over 20 million albums on the Gaon Music Chart , BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the best-selling album in South Korea with Map of the Soul: 7 . BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the IFPI 's Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won Top Social Artist three years in a row and Top Duo/Group at the 26th Billboard Music Awards . Featured on Time 's international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017\u20132019) and Time 's 100 most influential people in the world (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname \" Princes of Pop \". Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. BTS are ranked #4 of Billboard 's Top Social Artist of the 2010s, and are the highest group on the list. During their Love Yourself World Tour , BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium ; and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history. Billboard ranked BTS at #45 on their Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list, being the highest-ranked Asian as well as the only non-English speaking act on the list. As of 2019, BTS are purportedly worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, or 0.3 percent of the country's GDP. BTS attracted one in every 13 foreign tourists that visited South Korea and were cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018. Following the establishment of their Love Myself anti-violence campaign in partnership with UNICEF , BTS addressed the United Nations 73rd General Assembly and became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language. The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan ( Korean : \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 ; Hanja : \u9632\u5f48 \u5c11\u5e74 \u5718 ), literally meaning \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts\". According to member J-Hope , the name signifies the group's desire \"to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets\". In Japan, they are known as B\u014ddan Sh\u014dnendan ( \u9632\u5f3e\u5c11\u5e74\u56e3 ) , which translates similarly. In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for \"Beyond the Scene\" as part of their new brand identity. This extended their name to mean \"growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward.\" BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping. BTS was originally supposed to be a hip-hop group similar to YG Entertainment's 1TYM , but between their initial formation and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided that the contemporary youth needed instead \"a hero who can lend them a shoulder to lean on, even without speaking a single word\". The group was meant to debut in 2011 and featured on several tracks by artists such as 2AM and Lee Seung-gi before their debut was postponed and the group was reorganized into a more traditional idol group. The lineup was then finalized with Jin , Suga , J-Hope , RM , Jimin , V , and Jungkook in 2012. Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud . On June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool , the first installment in their \"school trilogy\" series, simultaneously with its lead single \"No More Dream\", which peaked at number 124 in Korea before quickly falling off the charts. While the album peaked at number five in South Korea and eventually sold over 145,000 copies, it was not a major hit, selling only 24,000 copies in 2013. Their subsequent single \u201cWe Are Bulletproof Pt. 2\u201d failed to chart. In 2 Cool 4 Skool , BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound with scratches from the 1980s-90s and excessively fierce visuals. From their inception, BTS was convinced that telling their story was the only way for the younger generation to relate to their music. The lyrics of the album primarily reflected on the misunderstanding and prejudice towards them, criticism of the society that diminishes their dreams, and their anxiety and determination towards their future. During the production of the album, Suga and RM rewrote the lyrics of \u201cNo More Dream\u201d more than 20 times. The single album's release was followed by several appearances on Korean music shows. Despite being unpolished, these early live performances demonstrated BTS' potential with their intense and charismatic stage presence. Expanding their endeavors to Japan, \"No More Dream\" was later re-recorded in Japanese and released in June 2014. In September 2013, BTS released the second part to their \"school trilogy,\u201d the extended play O!RUL8,2? , along with its single \"N.O,\u201d which peaked at number 92 in Korea. The EP peaked at number four in Korea and has sold over 160,000 copies to date, including 34,000 copies in its release year. Musically, BTS did not fundamentally change their sound as compared with 2 Cool 4 Skool , utilizing fiery rapping along with trap beats, brass, and soulful melodies . Lyrically, the EP expanded on the theme of dreams and happiness, revealing their frustration under the harsh Korean education system and their determination to confront the struggle of proving themselves. Despite several performances on Korean music shows, the single quickly fell off the charts. That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV 's Rookie King Channel Bangtan , based on a fake broadcast station, \"Channel Bangtan\", through which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea . At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, including the 5th Melon Music Awards , 28th Golden Disc Awards and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards . The last act to their \"school trilogy\", the EP Skool Luv Affair , was released in January 2014 and topped the Gaon Album Chart , selling 100,000 copies in 2014 and over 250,000 copies overall. It also marked BTS\u2019 first appearance on Billboard 's World Albums Chart, peaking at number three. The album was supported by the singles \"Boy in Luv\" (Korean: \uc0c1\ub0a8\uc790; RR: Sang-namja ) and \"Just One Day\" (Korean: \ud558\ub8e8\ub9cc; RR: Haruman ), which peaked at number 45 and number 149 in Korea, respectively. While Skool Luv Affair musically retained much of their hip-hop influences with the incorporation of R&B and hard rock, the album coincided with a thematic shift from dreams and happiness to love, focusing on school-age and youthful love. Following Skool Luv Affair\u2019s release, BTS made several appearances on Korean music shows and held their first fan meeting that March with an audience of 3,000 fans in Seoul . That July, BTS held their first concert in the United States in West Hollywood for free to an audience of 200 fans. In August, the group also made their first appearance at KCON in Los Angeles . In August 2014, BTS released their first Korean studio album, Dark & Wild , which peaked at number two in Korea and sold over 200,000 copies total. It was supported by two singles: \"Danger\" and \"War of Hormone\" (Korean: \ud638\ub974\ubaac \uc804\uc7c1; RR: Horeumon Jeonjaeng ), which peaked at number 58 and number 173 in Korea, respectively. The album served as a narrative extension of the \u201cschool trilogy\u201d and a transition into their next series. Musically, the album fused the grungy electric guitar sounds of rock within the framework of hip-hop and continued to expand their sound towards R&B . The central theme of the album's lyrics focused on expressing the sentiments of maturing, youthful desires, and impatience for romance. During production of the album, BTS recorded their single \"Danger\" in a makeshift studio in a garage in Los Angeles. Following several appearances on Korean music shows, BTS embarked on their first concert tour , 2014 BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet , from October to December, held in various halls and theaters in six cities: Seoul, Kobe , Tokyo , Manila , Singapore , and Bangkok . Their first Japanese studio album, Wake Up (2014), released that December, peaked at number three on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart and sold 28,000 copies. Along with re-recorded Japanese versions of older songs, it also contained the original tracks \"Wake Up\" and \"The Stars.\" In support of the album, BTS held their 1st Japan Tour 2015 Wake Up: Open Your Eyes in February 2015 to an audience of 25,000 fans in four cities. After ending their Japan tour, BTS held their second solo concert in Korea, BTS Live Trilogy Episode I: BTS Begins, in March to a crowd of 6,500 fans. Shifting their sound and image from solely aggressive, masculine hip hop to more diverse styles, BTS wanted to express the beauty and anxiousness of \"youth\" and settled on the title of \"\u82b1\u6a23\u5e74\u83ef\" (Korean: \ud654\uc591\uc5f0\ud654; RR: Hwayangyeonhwa ), loosely interpreted to define \"youth\" as \"the most beautiful moment in life.\" Their third EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 (March 2015), explored the growth and emotional agony of youth as well as its playful and uplifting sides. Fuse included it as the only Korean album on their list of the \"27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far.\" The EP has sold over 415,000 copies to date. Its lead single \" I Need U \" was BTS' first top five hit in Korea and garnered BTS first ever music show win on SBS MTV 's The Show . While its second single, \"Dope (Korean: \uca54\uc5b4; RR: Jjeoreo )\", only peaked at number 44 in Korea, it peaked at number three on Billboard ' s World Digital Songs Chart and became their first music video to accrue over 100 million views on YouTube in October. The group began the world tour extension of their Red Bullet Tour in June, titled 2015 Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet , visiting cities throughout Asia, Oceania, North America, and Latin America. Their fourth Japanese single, \"For You\", was released on June 17 to celebrate the first anniversary of their Japanese debut and topped Oricon 's daily chart, selling over 42,000 copies within its first day. BTS later performed at Japan's Summer Sonic Festival on August 15 and 16. In November, BTS commenced their third concert tour, 2015 BTS LIVE \"The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: On Stage\" , debuting their new song and the lead single from their fourth EP The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 , \"Run\", during the Seoul dates. Thematically, the EP focused more on the serious and speculative aspects of youth, touching on the pursuit of success, loneliness, affection for their origins, and the suffering of the younger generation due to unfavorable conditions in current society. Critically, it was praised as the successful merging of the style of The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 with BTS' initial identity. The album topped the weekly Gaon Album and Billboard World Albums charts and BTS became the first K-pop act to remain atop the latter for multiple weeks. It also marked their first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 171 with over 5,000 copies. BTS were awarded Best World Performer at the 17th Mnet Asian Music Awards in recognition of their international fan base. Their first Korean compilation album and the finale to their \"youth series\", The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever , was released in May 2016. It included three new singles: the top 40 hit \"Epilogue: Young Forever\", the top 10 hit \" Fire \" (Korean: \ubd88\ud0c0\uc624\ub974\ub124; RR: Bultaoreune ), and the top 20 hit \" Save Me \". The album topped Gaon Weekly Chart in Korea for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number 107 on the U.S. Billboard 200 . The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever later won BTS' first major Korean award for Album of the Year at the 8th Melon Music Awards . BTS embarked on their Asia tour extension, 2016 BTS LIVE \"The Most Beautiful Moment in Life On Stage: Epilogue\" , from May to August, visiting 10 cities and performing to 144,000 fans. During their tour, BTS held a landmark two-day concert at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul in May, and performed as first time headliners at both U.S. KCON shows held that year in Newark (June) and Los Angeles (July), to sold-out audiences. In line with their other successes, they became the first K-pop group to receive their own Twitter emoji in May 2016. In September 2016, BTS released their second Japanese studio album Youth . It sold over 44,000 copies on its first day of release and peaked at number one in Japan . Pre-orders for their second Korean studio album Wings , released in October 2016, accumulated over 500,000 copies within the first week. Wings combined the themes of youth presented in their previous \"youth series\" with temptation and adversity and, for the first time as a major group effort, included seven solo tracks that demonstrated each members' potential and individuality as independent musicians. The album was generally well-received by critics, with Rolling Stone naming it \"one of the most conceptually and sonically ambitious pop albums of 2016, \" while Fuse praised the \"vulnerable and honest song material\" and diverse tracks. The lead single \"Blood Sweat & Tears\" achieved a music chart \"all-kill\" in South Korea and became their first number one hit on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart. Its music video gained over 6 million views within 24 hours, breaking the previous record held on YouTube for the highest number of views of a K-pop group music video within 24 hours. Wings opened at number 26 on the U.S. Billboard 200, the highest chart ranking ever for a K-pop album, and BTS became the first Korean group to top the Billboard Social 50 chart that month. It was their first \"million seller\" album, moving over 1.5\u00a0million copies in South Korea that year and became the best-selling album in Gaon Album Chart history at the time. BTS were the first artist not from a \"Big Three\" entertainment company ( SM , YG and JYP ) to win Artist of the Year at the 18th Mnet Asian Music Awards in December. In February 2017, BTS released the repackaged edition of Wings (2016) , entitled You Never Walk Alone . Pre-orders of the repackage reached over 700,000 copies, breaking the record for most albums sold in a month. The repackage included an additional four tracks that offered consolation and encouragement to its listeners. Its lead single, \" Spring Day \" (Korean: \ubd04\ub0a0; RR: Bomnal ) met critical praise as \"an intelligent, compelling and elegantly restrained study of loss and longing\" that \"deliberately avoids clich\u00e9 pomp and drama\" by Dazed Digital . Embodying nostalgia and sorrow, it opened a new chapter in BTS' aesthetics and lyricism and attracted fans across generational boundaries. Upon release, \"Spring Day\" topped eight of the major South Korean online music charts, as well as Gaon, and crashed Melon 's digital chart due to the high influx of user traffic. It also entered the U.S. Billboard ' s Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart at number 15 with \"zero promotions.\" As evidence of its staying power, \"Spring Day\" is the longest-charting song on Melon by an idol group to date. \"Spring Day\" later won Best Song of the Year at the 9th Melon Music Awards . In conjunction with the release of You Never Walk Alone , BTS commenced their second world tour, 2017 BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour , from February to December. The tour visited 12 countries including Brazil, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States and gathered 550,000 fans. On the tour, BTS began to play progressively larger venues, moving from halls into arenas and domes. Tickets for the North American leg sold out within minutes and two additional shows were added due to high demand, making BTS the first K-pop act to sell out arenas in the United States. After completing their North American leg, BTS attended the 24th Billboard Music Awards in May and won Top Social Artist , becoming the first Korean group awarded a Billboard Music Award. Celebrating Korean music icon Seo Taiji 's 25th anniversary as a part of his anniversary project \"Time: Traveler\", BTS released a remake of Seo Taiji's 1995 classic \" Come Back Home \" in July 2017, reworking the sound and lyrics to similar sentiments toward societal change that Seo Taiji argued for in his songs. BTS was later invited by Seo Taiji to perform as backup vocalists and dancers for eight songs in his Seoul Olympic Stadium concert held early September. During the concert, Seo Taiji acknowledged BTS' thematic similarities to his music and recognized the group as his musical successors, declaring, \"This is your generation now. Show them.\" Following the depiction of growth and temptation in Wings (2016) and consolation in You Never Walk Alone (2017), BTS embarked on their \"Love Yourself\" series which sought the enlightenment of self-love through the \" \u8d77\u627f\u8f49\u7d50 \" (Korean: \uae30\uc2b9\uc804\uacb0; RR: G iseungjeongyeol ) narrative sequence of \"beginning, development, turn, and conclusion.\" In September 2017, BTS released the first part of the series, their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her and featured music from the Chainsmokers ' Andrew Taggart for the track \"Best of Me\". The EP was supported by two singles: the lead single \" DNA \" and a Steve Aoki remix of their song \" Mic Drop \" featuring American rapper Desiigner . In the narrative sequence, the EP represented the \"\u627f,\" or \"development\" of the series and is considered by RM to be one of the major turning points in BTS' career. Within the larger narrative, Love Yourself: Her described the joy and happiness of falling in love. Sonically, the EP served as \"a dual exploration of the group's electro-pop and hip-hop leanings,\" with the first half consisting of \u201cdance tracks that emphasize the group's vocals\" while in the second half \"the act's hip-hop side arrives in earnest...delivering powerful rap performances.\" Commercially, BTS continued to hit new career heights with the Love Yourself: Her EP, debuting at number seven on the Billboard 200 with 31,000 album-equivalent units. In Korea, the EP sold over 1.2\u00a0million copies on the Gaon Album Chart in its first month, achieving the highest monthly album sales in the chart's history and the highest on any Korean chart in 16 years, second to g.o.d 's Chapter 4 album in 2001. The single \"DNA\" was released simultaneously with the EP and debuted at number two in Korea. Its music video broke the previous record for most viewed K-pop group music video within the first 24 hours with more than 20 million views on YouTube . \"DNA\" also became the group's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 85, making BTS the first K-pop boy band to do so and the second Korean act with a Korean-language song. The following week, \"DNA\" rose to number 67 and became the highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 for a K-pop group, beating Wonder Girls ' previous record at number 76. The following single \" Mic Drop (Remix) \" peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first top 40 entry for a K-pop group on the chart. Both \"Mic Drop Remix\" and \"DNA\" were later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) making BTS the first and only Korean artist to receive two certifications. \"Mic Drop\" went on to receive Platinum certification in November 2018, making BTS the first Korean group with a Platinum-certified single in the United States. In December 2017, \"DNA\" and \"Mic Drop\" were released as a triple-A side single in Japan with the new song \"Crystal Snow\", which topped the Oricon Chart and became the highest-selling single from a K-pop artist within a week. The single sold more than 380,000 copies by the end of the year and BTS became the only foreign artist to have a single certified double platinum by the RIAJ that year. In November 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to perform at the American Music Awards , raising their profile internationally. That same month, Guinness World Records revealed that BTS had earned a spot in their 2018 edition for \"having the world's most Twitter engagements for a music group\". In December, they also became the first K-pop group to perform on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to welcome the new year and made their Japanese TV music show debut on TV Asahi ' s Japan Music Station Super Live . At the end of the year, BTS won their second Artist of the Year at the 19th Mnet Asian Music Awards , becoming the first act to win the award two years in a row. They also became the first artist outside of the \"Big Three\" to win major awards at the Golden Disc Awards and the Seoul Music Awards , respectively. In the lead up to their next album, BTS released an original eight-episode documentary series exclusively on YouTube Premium entitled Burn the Stage that ran from March until May 2018, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the group's 2017 Wings Tour. In April, the group also released their third Japanese studio album, Face Yourself , which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard 200 as the third-highest-charting Japanese album in the history of the chart. In conjunction with the release of Face Yourself , the group released a nine-minute short film titled \"Euphoria: Theme of Love Yourself: Wonder ,\" which featured the song \"Euphoria\" and embodied the \"\u8d77\" or \"beginning\" of the narrative sequence. In May 2018, BTS released their third Korean-language studio album, Love Yourself: Tear in conjunction with an appearance at the 25th Billboard Music Awards . At the show, BTS debuted as performers with the premiere of their lead single, \" Fake Love \" and won Top Social Artist , making them the only Korean artist to win the award two years in a row. In the narrative sequence, the album coincided with the \"\u8f49\" or \"turn\" of the series, touching on the tortuous enlightenment of loving without being loved and encouragement to those without dreams. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Caitlin Kelley from Billboard described the album as \"one of their most thematically cohesive yet sonically varied albums, with maximalist production erupting against lyrics about emptiness,\" while Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork wrote that the album \"formula is a slick, loosely thematic album about love and loss, with a stronger focus on rapping than ever before\" and that it \"aims for cohesion and produces fun, prismatic songs in the process.\" Commercially, Love Yourself: Tear was one of BTS' most successful albums, bringing them to new heights both domestically and internationally. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with 135,000 album-equivalent units (including 100,000 pure album sales), becoming BTS' highest-charting and first number one album in the US, the first K-pop album to top the U.S. albums chart, and the highest-charting album by an Asian act. Love Yourself: Tear also became BTS' first top ten hit in the United Kingdom , reaching number eight on the UK Albums Chart . Their single \"Fake Love\" became their first top ten hit at number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the seventeenth non-English song to reach the top ten and the first by a Korean group. \"Fake Love\" later became their third single to attain Gold certification by the RIAA that August. In South Korea, Love Yourself: Tear sold over 1.6 million copies in its first two weeks, making it the highest monthly sales for an album since the Gaon Chart's inception at that time. As the conclusion of the Love Yourself series, BTS released their second Korean compilation album Love Yourself: Answer in August 2018, which contained songs from the previous Love Yourself releases along with seven additional new tracks. The album was supported by the lead single \" Idol \" and the alternative digital release featuring Nicki Minaj . Thematically, Love Yourself: Answer placed the songs of the Love Yourself series within the narrative of beginning, development, turn and conclusion to illustrate the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of self-love. Critically, the album received generally positive reviews, with Billboard calling it a \"masterful culmination of years of work and rife with meaning\" and \"undeniably a magnum opus from BTS that that few other artists, boy bands or otherwise, ever can hope to achieve.\" Commercially, the record sold over 1.9 million copies on the Gaon Album Chart in August 2018, breaking the chart's all-time monthly record once again. The album became BTS' second number-one album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and their highest sales week in the country at that time, making BTS the only K-pop act with two Billboard 200 toppers and the first pop act with two number one albums in less than a year since One Direction topped the chart with Midnight Memories in 2013 and Four in 2014. Love Yourself: Answer later became the first Korean language album to be certified Gold by the RIAA in November. In Canada, Love Yourself: Answer became the band's first number-one album on the Canadian Albums Chart . In the United States, \"Idol\" peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 . The single \"Idol\" also reached number five on the Canadian Singles Chart , marking BTS' first top-ten hit in Canada. The music video for \"Idol\" received over 45 million views in its first 24 hours on YouTube, breaking the record previously set by Taylor Swift with \" Look What You Made Me Do \". \"Idol\" and Love Yourself: Answer later received platinum certifications, both selling more than one million certified units in the United States. \"Idol\" became the group's third Platinum single while Answer became the group's first Platinum album, making BTS the first Korean artist to attain this certification in the US. In conjunction with Love Yourself: Answer ' s release in August 2018, BTS commenced their third world tour, BTS World Tour: Love Yourself , with a landmark concert in the Seoul Olympic Stadium , the largest stadium in South Korea. During their tour, BTS also featured on Steve Aoki 's single \" Waste It On Me \" released that October, which was their first and only all-English language feature. On tour, BTS continued to play to progressively larger venues from arenas to domes to stadiums. For the final stop of the North American leg, the band performed at Citi Field in Queens , marking the first time a Korean act has performed at a U.S. stadium. All 40,000 tickets for the stadium date sold out in under 20 minutes. According to StubHub BTS was one of 2018's best-selling concerts in international markets outside the US, second to only Ed Sheeran . Vivid Seats named BTS the 2018 artist of the year, citing the group's history-making concert at Citi Field. The tour also received generally positive reviews from critics. Philip Cosores from Uproxx described BTS' four nights at the Staples Center as an \"enormous, multi-sensory experience\" bringing an \"inclusive\" and \"multicultural experience\" where music is above any language barrier, while Crystal Bell from MTV said \"BTS have created an experience so captivating, so inclusive, and so visually stunning that it\u2019s cemented the boy band as one of the most vital acts in pop music today.\" That October, with more than a year remaining in their contract, BTS renewed their contract with Big Hit Entertainment through 2026. In early November 2018, a popular Japanese music show cancelled BTS' performance citing a T-shirt a member wore the year before. In the same month the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) stated BTS owed victims an apology for the shirt in 2017, clothing with Nazi symbolism, and a flag. Big Hit Entertainment issued an apology, saying that the images on the clothing were not intended to be hurtful to the victims of Nazism or atomic bombings, and that the band and management would take steps to prevent future mistakes. They also stated the flags were meant to be a commentary on the Korean school system. The apology was accepted by SWC and the Korean Atomic Bomb Victim Association. Crossing over to film, BTS released Burn the Stage: The Movie in theaters worldwide in November 2018 to commercial success. In the United States it accumulated $1.2 million on opening day for a total of $3.54 million over the three day weekend, breaking the record for the highest grossing event cinema musical production which was previously set in 2014 by the band One Direction. It ranked at number ten in the box office despite selling at only 620 locations compared to the 2,000-4,000 locations for the other top ten sellers. At the end of the year, BTS won their third Artist of the Year at the 20th Mnet Asian Music Awards in a row and ranked number eight on Billboard's year-end Top Artist Chart alongside the likes of Drake and Taylor Swift and were also the number two act of the year in the Duo/Group ranking, only behind Imagine Dragons . They also made the Bloomberg 50 due to their \"willingness to address social issues, mental health, and politics, despite being in a genre often painted as bubble gum pop\". The group sold more than ten millions albums in South Korea alone, with five million being sold in 2018 alone. In February 2019, BTS attended the 61st Grammy Awards as award presenters. It was their first time attending the event following an appearance by the group at the LA Grammy Museum in 2018. In April, BTS became the first Asian act to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify , and Time named them as one of Time 100 's most influential people of 2019. Their sixth EP, Map of the Soul: Persona , was released on April 12 with the lead single \" Boy With Luv \" (Korean: \uc791\uc740 \uac83\ub4e4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc; RR: Jageun geotdeureul wihan si ), featuring American singer Halsey . The EP's release was followed by a performance on Saturday Night Live , as the first Korean act to do so. The group's appearance was anticipated as one of the biggest in the show's history. Commercially, BTS reached new career heights. Map of the Soul: Persona became the first Korean-language album to reach the number one position in both the UK and Australia and the group's third consecutive album to top the Billboard 200 and the third within eleven months, joining the likes of the Beatles , who achieved the same in 1995\u201396.

BTS have cited Seo Taiji and Boys , Nas , Eminem , Kanye West , Drake , Post Malone , Charlie Puth and Danger as musical inspirations. They have also cited Queen as an influence, with Suga saying he \"grew up watching videos of Live Aid .\u201d During their concert at Wembley Stadium in London, Jin paid tribute to Queen by leading the crowd in a version of Freddie Mercury \u2019s \"ay-oh\" chant from the band's Live Aid concert. BTS are also influenced by many literary, psychological, artistic, and philosophical mediums. Their album Wings (2016) was inspired by Hermann Hesse's coming of age novel, Demian . Their song \" Blood Sweat and Tears \" references Friedrich Nietzsche 's Thus Spoke Zurathustra , Herbert James Draper 's The Lament for Icarus , Pieter Bruegel 's Landscape with the Fall of Icarus , and Pieter Bruegel's The Fall of the Rebel Angels by quoting Nietzsche and featuring the three aforementioned paintings in the music video. Their \"Spring Day\" music video contains lyrical and visual references to Ursula Le Guin 's short story The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas . The Love Yourself series was primarily influenced by Erich Fromm 's The Art of Loving , while their song \"Magic Shop\" from Love Yourself: Tear (2018) was inspired by James R. Doty 's memoir Into the Magic Shop . Their 2019 album Map of the Soul: Persona gains its name from Murray Stein's Jung's Map of the Soul: An Introduction . BTS co-writes, produces, and composes much of their output. Since their inception, BTS have developed and maintained a style of \"fusion music\" with an emphasis on hip hop as their musical base largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as underground rappers and their main producer Pdogg. Rather than wanting to stick to a specific genre, BTS have introduced brand new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album. BTS' sound began with old-school hip hop influences heard on 2 Cool 4 Skool and O!RUL8,2? , but evolved to include R&B and rock with Skool Luv Affair and Dark and Wild , orchestral strings and electronic dance music with their The Most Beautiful Moment in Life album series, moombahton , neo soul , and gospel in Wings and You Never Walk Alone , future bass , Latin pop , and jazz hip hop in their Love Yourself album series and emo rap , rap-rock , Afro pop , nu-disco , funk , trap and pop-rap in their Map of the Soul album series. BTS' lyrics include social commentary , often incorporating criticism of South Korean society. Songs such as \" No More Dream \" and \" N.O \" from their \"school trilogy\" were motivated by their experiences with South Korea's emphasis on education and called for change to the education system and societal expectations. Their experiences with youth culture in South Korea inspired songs like \" Dope \" and \" Silver Spoon \" (Korean: \ubc41\uc0c8; RR: Baepsae ) from their \"youth series,\" referencing generational disparity and the millennial 's giving up of romantic relationships, marriage, children, proper employment, homes, and social life in the face of economic difficulties and societal ills while facing condemnation from the media and older generations. The song \" Am I Wrong \" from Wings (2016) questioned societal apathy towards the state of current events\u2014the lyric \"We're all dogs and pigs / we become dogs because we're angry\" referenced the South Korean Ministry of Education official Na Hyang-wook who was a proponent of the caste system and described the average person as \"dogs and pigs,\" and BTS performed the song on television during the 2016 South Korean political scandal that led to the impeachment of ex-President Park Geun-hye . RM and Suga's personal struggles with mental health inspired songs like \" Tomorrow \", \" Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life \", \"So Far Away\", \"The Last\", and \" Forever Rain .\" \" Not Today \" from You Never Walk Alone (2017) is an anti-establishment anthem, with messages advocating for minority groups, while \" Spring Day \" was created to memorialize the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy . BTS' albums have recurring themes that fall under the overarching theme of \"reflection of youth.\" Their \"school trilogy\" explored \"the troubles and anxieties of school-age youth.\" Their \"youth series\" \"tackled a subject that the vast majority of youth experience, but few pop musicians articulate well: mental health and the desire to belong in society.\" Wings (2016) focused on temptation and sin. The \"Love Yourself\" series utilized a narrative form to illustrate the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of self-love. Since their inception, BTS have held the belief that telling their story is the only way for the younger generation to relate to their music. Writing over 90 percent of their lyrics, BTS try to include experiences everyone has felt in life, such as sadness and loneliness, and turn them to something more light and manageable. In regards to their lyricism, RM states he tries to not sound as if they're preaching or reprimanding people in their songs as everyone has different lives and different destinies. When asked if it is difficult to write about things like mental health, Suga responded, BTS has been praised for \"speak[ing] honestly about topics they deem important, even in a conservative society\" by Jeff Benjamin in Fuse magazine . South Korean president Moon Jae-in , in a letter to BTS, recognized their sincerity and inclusion of diversity as key to their success, writing, \"Each of the seven members sings in a way that is true to himself and the life he wants to live. Their melody and lyrics transcend regional borders, language, culture, and institutions.\" BTS have been described as \"easily the biggest and most successful name in K-pop in the world\" that can \"do things no other name in their genre can\", with Time giving them the nickname \"Princes of Pop\". Billboard Senior Vice President Silvio Pietroluongo said that BTS are comparable and as influential to the Beatles and The Monkees . Nielsen Music Vice President Helena Kosinski says that \"although BTS weren't the first to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They don't just appeal to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic.\" As the first non-English speaking artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming platforms, coming second only to Drake . In 2019, BTS were again named as one of the top 10 Global Recording Artists of the year by IFPI , for a second time, ranking #7. They were the only non-English speaking act on that list. In the United States, BTS accounted for 72.7 percent of the album consumption units generated by K-pop acts in 2018 out of a total of 17 acts. In South Korea, BTS accounted for 41.9 percent of album sales in the first half of 2019, up from their market share of 25.3 percent the previous year. In November 2019, Billboard ranked BTS at #4 on their Top Social Artist of the 2010s list, making them the highest group on the list. BTS was also ranked #45 on Billboard' s Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list. They are the highest-ranked Asian act on the list as well as the only non-English speaking act. BTS have been often regarded as \" the biggest boy band in the world \". They have also appeared in various power listings.

In 2019, BTS ranked 43rd on Forbes ' annual list of the 100 highest-paid celebrities with earnings of $57 million.

Other notable people included in this list were Malala Yousafzai and Bill Gates . In California , BTS inspired a teacher to have his school be the first in the country to offer a Korean American Culture and Society course. Kang Soojung, exhibition manager at the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, said that while preparing the 50th anniversary exhibition called \u201cSquare,\u201d she was greatly influenced by BTS's hidden track \u201cSea\". The group's influence has led them to address the United Nations at their 73rd General Assembly and to perform before 400 officials including South Korean president Moon Jae-in at the 2018 Korea-France Friendship Concert in Paris , a summit meant to show the friendly relations between France and South Korea. Moon Hee-sang , Speaker of the National Assembly, said that \"BTS is doing most of our work,\u201d attributing the results of his overseas trip to the credit of the global group on an overseas trip to promote \u201csales diplomacy\". In September 2019, president Moon Jae-in also mentioned BTS in his announcement for his '3 major innovation strategies for the contents industry', stating that BTS has pioneered innovative business models that communicate directly with fans. In October 2019, The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism selected BTS as a recipient for a 'Letter of Appreciation', for showing the world the beauty of Korean traditional culture (Hangul, Hanbok, Gugak) through creative re-interpretations in their music. In December 2019, according to the annual survey conducted by Gallup Korea, BTS were the most preferred artists of 2019 for a second consecutive year. According to the \"2019 South Korean National Image\" survey conducted by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and its affiliate the Korean Culture and Information Service among 16 countries, BTS were chosen #2 with 5.5% votes. Despite cultural medals traditionally being given to recipients with more than 15 years of notable achievements, BTS became the youngest ever recipients honored with the Order of Cultural Merit by the President of South Korea in 2018 after five years after debuting, due to their noteworthy contributions in spreading Korean culture and language. BTS have measurably revitalized the Korean economy and the global music industry. Credited for the surge in popularity of online purchases of K-pop items and the growth of the Korean Wave between 2016 and 2018 by the Korea Customs Service and Korea Foundation , BTS were cited as one of the main driving forces for the recovery of South Korea's music-related sector to levels seen before China's 2016 ban on domestic cultural contents over soured diplomatic relations. Yung Duk Kim, vice president and chief operating officer of the Korea Creative Content Agency , stated K-pop has \u201cskyrocketed\u201d since BTS' popularity surged, creating jobs not only for BTS and their team but other K-pop idols as well. Various news outlets coined the term the \"BTS effect\" to refer to the commercial effects of BTS' influence, such as when KB Kookmin Bank savings accounts increased six-fold compared to the prior year following BTS' endorsement and when stock prices of entertainment companies in South Korea shot up for five days after BTS topped the U.S. Billboard 200 . The effect was also observed when companies tied to BTS, such as Netmarble , NetMark, Soribada , Key Shares, GMP, Diffie, and Mattel had their stocks rise. In October 2019, Mattel 's international gross sales rose 10% to $721.7 million, lifted by sales of dolls based on BTS.

BTS' two day fan-meetings held in Seoul and Busan in June 2019 generated a total economic effect of \u20a9481 billion ($408 million) to both cities, accounting for 1.6% of Busan's 2018 GDP , and 0.9% of Seoul's 2018 GDP.

On April 19, 2012, SM Entertainment officially announced the formation of the subgroup and hinted at the possibility of other future subgroups, explaining, \"the members of the unit [are rotated] according to the [unique] music and concept of each new subgroup album.\" Compared to Girls' Generation, TTS's main focus is on each member's vocal ability while the original group places more emphasis on the overall songs and uniform group performances.

The group currently consists of five members: Solji , LE , Hani , Hyelin and Jeonghwa . EXID debuted in February 2012, with the single \"Whoz That Girl\". Though the album gained some attention, it was not until 2014 that the group unexpectedly gained popularity with the single \" Up & Down \", which reached number one on the Gaon Singles Chart four months after release due to a fan-recording of a live performance becoming a viral video . EXID released their second EP Ah Yeah in April 2015, to commercial success. They followed this with their first studio album Street (2016) and the EPs Eclipse and Full Moon (2017). In May 2011, producer Shinsadong Tiger and AB Entertainment scouted several trainees from JYP Entertainment to form a new girl group. Trainee Yuji was the first to join when a JYP girl group failed to debut. Yuji contacted the trainees Hani, Haeryeong, and Jeonghwa to audition for AB, and all three were subsequently accepted into the agency. The group added a fifth member when Shinsadong Tiger discovered LE , an underground rapper and songwriter who performed under the name Elly. Dami, who was already an AB trainee, was the sixth and last member added to the group. Originally named \"WT\", an acronym for \"Who's That\", the group changed their name to EXID a few months before their debut. In December 2011, LE was featured in Huh Gak 's single \"Whenever You Play That Song\", which appeared on Korean music charts. EXID was scheduled to debut in January 2012, but their debut was delayed to February when LE sustained a leg injury during rehearsals. On February 3, AB Entertainment announced that EXID would debut with the single \"Whoz That Girl\". Video teasers featuring the members doing solo performances were subsequently released online. EXID released their first single \"Whoz That Girl\" from the digital single album Holla , on February 16, 2012. They made their debut performance on M!

On August 24, 2014, EXID held their comeback showcase at the Ilchi Art Hall, performing their new song \" Up & Down \". The song was released on August 27, 2014 and initially charted poorly, failing to make it onto the top 100 of the Gaon Chart ; though it peaked at number 94 on the domestic chart. However, the song slowly gained popularity in early October 2014 after a fan-recorded video of Hani performing the song went viral on South Korean social networking websites. This led to the song shooting back up record charts, eventually climbing into the top 10 on the real-time charts and topping the Gaon Chart. Because of the success of the fancam, EXID was invited back onto stage to promote despite the fact their promotions ended months prior. Due to this success, EXID returned to several music programs to promote \"Up and Down\". The song was subsequently nominated for a first place award on Show! Music Core , Inkigayo , and M Countdown , where they took their first music show win since debut.

Current members Say and J-Da made an appearance in labelmate Block B 's music video \"NanlinA\", alongside two other former members of the group, Song Kwanghee and Lee Dasom, the latter who was formerly a member of the girl group Tahiti. Jucy was also an underground rapper known as \"Juni.J\", and had released a few tracks of her own, having penned her own lyrics.\nOn July 12, 2012, EvoL's first audio teaser was released, followed by a series of both video and audio teasers that showcased a sample of songs from their EP. On August 10, 2012 the group released their EP \"\ud3ed\ud30c\ud574\uc918! (Let Me Explode!)\" and an MV for the single \"\uc6b0\ub9b0 \uc880 \ub2ec\ub77c (We Are A Bit Different)\". The album consists of five tracks and is available on CD and also for digital download.\nOn August 16, 2012, EvoL made their stage debut with their single \"\uc6b0\ub9b0 \uc880 \ub2ec\ub77c (We Are A Bit Different)\" on M!Countdown. On December 13, 2012, Say tweeted a photo of herself and the other members, with the caption: \"It's New EVOL! \ubcf4\uace0\uc2f6\uc5b4 \ub9ce\uc774\ub9ce\uc774 Guyz how do u do~we miss u so so much..Thanks 4 waiting us. We'll meet u r expectation soon\". On March 6, 2013, EvoL announced their official comeback set for March 18, releasing teaser images of Say and Hayana, while J-DA, Yull and Jucy's teasers were released two days later. EvoL then released several tracks from their 2nd mini-album \u2018Second Evolution\u2019 on March 18 at noon, with the digital album release on March 19. The offline release of the album was set for March 20. EvoL showed their \u201ccrab dance\u201d choreography in the music video for their title track \u201cGet Up\u201c and released a short 30-second clip teaser of member J-DA riding a mechanical bull. In the summer of 2013, Jucy released a mixtape, and in May 2015, she joined the cast of Show Me The Money (seasons 2 and 4), only to be eliminated very early on in the competition. During the summer of 2015 rumors appeared on fansites alleging that Say's contract with Stardom had expired and that she had left EvoL (while still remaining with Stardom Entertainment), and would redebut as a solo artist. Fans also alleged favouritism from Cho PD on Say's behalf, claiming that they had given her special treatment (giving her time off, allowing her to skip group performances, etc.). Cho PD and Stardom Entertainment have never responded officially to these claims. In August 2015, it was revealed that Yull, Hayana and J-Da had had their contracts terminated without their knowledge during Stardom's merge with Hunus Entertainment, thus effectively disbanding the group. In the fall of 2015 Say began a solo project under the name \"$aay Choreography\" and redebuted as a solo artist in 2017 under the stage name SAAY, releasing her first full album in May 2018. Hayana also redebuted as a solo artist in 2017, and has released three singles. In October 2016, J-Da joined the group Oh!Bliss, using her real name YeonJoo. "}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exo_(band)", "name": "Exo (band)", "labels": ["SM", "Avex"], "intro": " Exo ( Korean : \uc5d1\uc18c ; stylized in all caps ) is a South Korean\u2013Chinese boy band based in Seoul , with nine members: Xiumin , Suho , Lay , Baekhyun , Chen , Chanyeol , D.O. , Kai and Sehun . The band was formed by SM Entertainment in 2011 and debuted in 2012. Their music incorporates genres like pop , hip-hop , and R&B , alongside electronic dance music genres like house , trap , and synth-pop . Exo releases and performs music in Korean , Mandarin , and Japanese . The band ranked as one of the top five most influential celebrities on the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity list each year from 2014 to 2018, and have been named \"the biggest boy band in the world\" and the \" kings of K-pop \" by media outlets. Since 2014, Exo has exclusively performed as one group, while continuing to release and perform music in multiple languages. Previously, the band debuted with twelve members separated into two sub-groups: Exo-K (Suho, Baekhyun, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, and Sehun) and Exo-M (Xiumin, Lay, Chen, and former members Kris , Luhan , and Tao ). Exo-K and Exo-M performed music in Korean and Mandarin, respectively, until the release of their third EP Overdose in 2014. After the departures of Kris, Luhan, and Tao amid legal battles in 2014 and 2015, the band continued with the remaining nine members. Since 2016, Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin have also released music and performed as a sub-unit named Exo-CBX , and members Sehun and Chanyeol have promoted as a sub-unit named Exo-SC since 2019. All of Exo's members also maintain solo careers in fields including music, film, and television. Exo's first album XOXO (2013), which contains the breakthrough hit \" Growl \", was a critical and commercial success. It sold over one million copies, making Exo the best-selling Korean artist in twelve years. Subsequent albums and EPs have also had strong sales, with all Korean studio albums each selling more than one million copies. Exo has won many awards for their albums, including five consecutive Album of the Year wins at the Mnet Asian Music Awards and two consecutive Artist of the Year wins at the Melon Music Awards . Exo's sixth album Don't Mess Up My Tempo (2018) is their highest-charting album on the US Billboard 200 , debuting at number 23. It is also their best selling album with over 1.9 million copies sold in South Korea. Since Exo's first headlining tour in 2014, the band has performed over 100 concerts across four tours and has participated in multiple joint tours. Exo is also known for its work beyond music, which includes endorsement deals with brands such as Nature Republic and Samsung , and philanthropic efforts such as Smile For U, a joint SM Entertainment and UNICEF project that began in 2015, and in which Exo continues to participate. In 2011, SM Entertainment CEO , Lee Soo-man , revealed plans to debut a new boy band that would be divided into two sub-groups, promoting the same music simultaneously in South Korea and China by performing songs in both Korean and Mandarin. After several member changes in December 2011, the group finalized its name as Exo, taken from the word \" exoplanet \". The news of an upcoming debut from SM Entertainment attracted substantial media attention from within South Korea and internationally, with many comparing Exo to fellow SM boy band TVXQ . It was also reported that Exo would compete with a new girl group from rival YG Entertainment . Exo-K's leader, Suho , was the first member to join SM Entertainment, after a successful audition through the company's casting system in 2006. The following year, Kai , with encouragement from his father, auditioned at the SM Youth Best Contest; he won and received a contract. Chanyeol , who took second place in a Smart Model Contest, and Sehun , who went through four auditions in two years, were the next members to become trainees in 2008. In 2010, Exo-K's D.O. sang for his audition and was eventually offered a contract. The last member of Exo-K to become a trainee was Baekhyun , who joined in 2011 through SM Entertainment's casting system and trained for approximately one year before debut. In Exo-M, Kris auditioned in 2008 at a global SM Entertainment audition in Canada, before moving to South Korea for training. That same year, Lay auditioned in Changsha, China, and subsequently moved to South Korea, while Xiumin attended an audition with his friend and won second place. In 2010, Luhan was scouted by an SM Entertainment representative in Seoul and passed his audition, while Tao was scouted at a talent show. The last member to join Exo-M was Chen , who took part in the casting system in 2011. The band's first televised performance was at the annual SBS Gayo Daejeon event on December 29, 2011. Exo-K and Exo-M debuted with the single \" Mama \" on April 8, 2012, followed by the EP Mama on April 9. The two sub-groups promoted the album separately; Exo-K performed on South Korean music program The Music Trend while Exo-M performed on the Top Chinese Music Awards in Shenzhen on the same day. The Korean version of the EP peaked at number one on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart and at number eight on the Billboard World Albums Chart, while the Mandarin version reached number two on China's Sina Album Chart and number one on various Chinese streaming platforms. Prior its debut, Exo released two singles, titled \"What Is Love\" and \"History\u201d, which peaked at number 88 on and number 68 respectively on the Gaon Digital Chart and at number six on the Sina Music Chart. Exo was awarded Best New Asian Group at the 2012 Mnet Asian Music Awards and the Newcomer Award at the Golden Disc Awards . The group's first studio album, XOXO , was released on June 3, 2013, in two versions: one in Korean and one in Mandarin. Unlike the EP Mama , for which Exo-K and Exo-M had separate promotions, XOXO was jointly promoted, mainly in South Korea. Exo recorded the album's lead single \" Wolf \" together, but the rest of the album tracks were recorded separately. A repackaged version of the album, titled Growl , was released on August 5, 2013, with three additional tracks. New single \"Growl\" peaked at number three on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 and at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. All versions of XOXO collectively sold over one million copies, making Exo the first South Korean artists to reach that milestone in 12 years. That December, Exo released a second EP, Miracles in December , as a special winter album containing the single of the same name. Prior to the release, the group promoted the album through their first reality show, Exo's Showtime , which premiered on November 28, 2013 on the cable channel MBC Every 1 . Following their 2013 releases, Exo won Song of the Year at the Melon Music Awards for \"Growl\", Disc Daesang at the Golden Disc Awards and Album of the Year at the Mnet Asian Music Awards for XOXO , and the Daesang at the Seoul Music Awards . In addition, Exo-M received the Most Popular Group Award at the 2013 Top Chinese Music Awards . Exo's third EP, Overdose , was released on May 7, 2014. Originally scheduled to be released on April 21, the album was delayed due to the Sewol Ferry accident on April 16. Overdose was promoted similarly to Mama , with Exo-K in South Korea and Exo-M promoting primarily in China. The album had over 660,000 pre-orders, making it the most pre-ordered Korean EP in history. The Korean edition also peaked at number two on Billboard ' s World Albums Chart, and at number 129 on the Billboard 200, making Exo the highest-ever charting male Korean group at that time. Overdose became the best selling release of 2014 in South Korea, and was the first EP to top the yearly charts and win the Album of the Year Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . On December 22, Exo released their first live album, Exology Chapter 1: The Lost Planet The album's single, \"December, 2014 (The Winter's Tale)\", peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, making it Exo's first number one single. By the end of 2014, Exo was Japan's best-selling K-pop artist of the year. On May 15, 2014, Kris filed a lawsuit against Sm Entertainment to terminate his contract and alleged that SM: disregarded his health; maintained unfair profit distributions; restricted his freedom; and treated him like a product rather than a person. On May 24, the group began its first headlining tour, \" Exo from Exoplanet 1 \u2013 The Lost Planet \", at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena . Tickets for the concert sold out in 1.47 seconds, breaking the record for the quickest concert sell-out by a Korean artist. On October 10, Luhan also filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment to terminate his contract. He cited health problems and alleged he was treated differently than the band's Korean members. On March 7, 2015, Exo began their second headlining world tour, \" Exoplanet 2 \u2013 The Exo'luxion \", with 70,000 attendees across five nights at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul. The group released its second studio album Exodus on March 30, 2015, in both Korean and Mandarin versions. Domestic pre-orders for the album surpassed 500,000 copies within 24 hours, setting a new record for pre-orders. Lead single \" Call Me Baby \" was released ahead of schedule, on March 27, because versions of the song had been leaked online. The music videos were released four days later; the Korean version later became the most-watched K-pop music video of the first half of 2015. The album spent a record four consecutive weeks at number one on the Gaon Album Chart and sold over a million copies, making it Exo's second album to do so, after XOXO. Exodus won Album of the Year at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards , giving Exo their third consecutive win. In April 2015, Exodus peaked at number 95 on the US Billboard 200, making the group the highest charting Korean artist. Exo also entered Billboard' s Canadian Hot 100 chart at number 98, making them the first K-pop group and second Korean artist to chart there. Tao was absent during promotions for Exodus due to injuries and, on August 24, became the third member to file a lawsuit against SM Entertainment to terminate his contract. This followed social media posts earlier in the year from Tao's father on Chinese social network Weibo , expressing his wish for his son to withdraw from the group and return to China due to health issues and a lack of support for individual career development. SM responded to his legal action with a statement: \"Our company plans to use everything in our power including both Korean and Chinese legal professionals and partners to respond legally both in Korea and China in a multi-faceted manner. We also plan to take legal steps to respond to Tao's illegal promotions and actions.\" Exo released a repackaged version of Exodus , titled Love Me Right , on June 3, 2015. This edition added four new songs, including the single \" Love Me Right \". Due to Tao's absence, the group promoted the song as nine members. That October, Exo became the first artists to hold a dome concert in South Korea; it was called \"Exo \u2013 Love Concert in Dome\", and took place at the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul. On November 4, 2015, Exo released their Japanese debut single Love Me Right ~romantic universe~ , which contains the Japanese version of \"Love Me Right\" and an original Japanese song titled \"Drop That\". On the day of its release, the album sold 147,000 copies and reached the top of the Oricon chart, becoming the all-time best-selling debut single in Japan by a Korean artist. Five days later, Exo released a special single titled \" Lightsaber \" to promote the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens ahead of its release in South Korea, as part of a collaboration between SM Entertainment and Walt Disney . On December 10, Exo released its second winter special release and fourth EP, Sing for You , containing the singles \" Sing for You \" and \" Unfair \". The album sold 267,900 copies in its first week, breaking the record for the highest first-week sales by a Korean artist. \"Unfair\" also became the first K-pop song to be featured in the \"Best of the Week\" playlist by Apple Music , and Exo became the first Korean artists to appear on the platform's homepage. Part of the profits from the album were donated to UNICEF 's Smile For U campaign, to support the music education for children in Asia. In December 2015, South Korean entertainment industry leaders ranked Exo at number seven in the top ten pop culture leaders of 2015, the highest rank held by a K-pop artist. On January 5, 2016, SM Entertainment won one of its countersuits against Tao following the ruling of the Intermediate People's Court in Qingdao, China. The company sued Tao over his failure to repay the company after his departure; it released an official statement that said: \"SM has ongoing lawsuits against Exo members Wu Yifan (Kris), Luhan, and Tao for violating their exclusive contracts and partaking in illegal promotions in China. Among these lawsuits, SM filed a lawsuit against Tao for failing to repay SM on October 13, 2015. An intermediate court in Qingdao, China made the verdict that Tao is to repay SM Entertainment as well as interest for the delayed payment.\" Exo's third studio album Ex'Act and its singles, \" Lucky One \" and \" Monster \", were released on June 9, 2016, in both Korean and Mandarin versions. Domestic pre-orders for the album exceeded 660,000 copies, making it the most pre-ordered K-pop album ever at that time. The album broke the record for the highest first-week sales of a Korean album, previously set by the band's own fourth EP Sing For You. \"Monster\" became Exo's first number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, and \"Lucky One\" debuted at number three. On August 18, 2016, a repackaged edition of the album, titled Lotto , was released; it added four new songs, including the single of the same name. \" Lotto \" became Exo's second number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs Chart, and peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. The repackaged edition's Korean and Mandarin versions reached number one and two on the Gaon Album Chart, respectively Within two months of its original release, Ex'Act had sold over 1.17 million copies, becoming Exo's third album to sell over one million copies, earning them the title of \"triple million sellers\" from the media. On July 21, contractual disputes between Kris and Luhan and SM Entertainment were settled. The two sides settled during their third court-mandated arbitration; the previous two were held in September 2015 and June 2016, when the court settled the case with a recommendation for reconciliation. The singers will maintain their contracts with SM until 2022. SM would contract out their work outside of Korea and Japan; i.e., Kris and Luhan's Chinese agencies will \"share related revenues\" with SM for activities anywhere but Korea and Japan (where SM has exclusive rights per their contract) because SM is technically \"contract[ing] out management\" for its non-Korean/Japanese activities until 2022, when their contracts with SM expire. On July 22, Exo embarked on its third headlining tour, \" Exoplanet 3 \u2013 The Exo'rdium \", with a record six consecutive concerts at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena. On May 28, 2017, the tour ended with the second of two consecutive concerts at the Seoul Olympic Stadium , the largest stadium in South Korea, with an estimated maximum seating capacity of 100,000.

Exo's seventh studio album, Obsession , was released on November 27, 2019. In October 2016, SM Entertainment formed the group's first sub-unit, Exo-CBX (also known as Chen-Baek-Xi), which is composed of three members: Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin. Exo-CBX has released one studio album: Magic (2018) and three extended plays: Hey Mama! (2016), Girls (2017), and Blooming Days (2018). In July 2019, SM Entertainment formed the group's second sub-unit, Exo-SC , which is composed of members Sehun and Chanyeol. They released their first extended play titled What a Life on July 22. Exo are considered by many to be a vocal powerhouse in the K-pop industry; the group's three main vocalists D.O., Chen, and Baekhyun have received praise from industry figures and the media. Beginning in 2013, Exo has released special winter-themed EPs in December nearly every year. These EPs feature many classic, emotional ballads, diverging from the dramatic and upbeat singles usually featured on the band's full-length albums. Billboard applauded the band's single \"Universe\" from the 2017 EP of the same name, saying, \"With soaring, emotive vocals courtesy of the Exo members, 'Universe' is a power ballad that showcases the group's strengths.\" The group has frequently worked with veteran Korean and international producers, including Kenzie , Dean , LDN Noise , The Underdogs , and MARZ Music. Many of Exo's songs \u2013 especially the singles, which blend pop, hip-hop, and R&B with electronic dance music genres like house, trap, and synth-pop\u2013 are produced with onstage performance in mind. Producer Harvey Mason Jr. commented: \"We listen to their material ... and try and go one step further. We try and do things that are fresh and original but yet still sound like Exo. ...They can sing, they can dance, they have the energy ... It's like a painter having every color to paint with.\" Early in their career, Exo were described by Billboard as sounding \"wholly inspired by the late '90s/early '00s sound ... with bigger beats, loads more hooks and adding rap and dance breakdowns.\" The group explored a more \"mature\" and \"dark\" sound in 2016 with the release of their third studio album, Ex'Act , featuring an increased use of electronic dance music styles like house and synth-pop. Their fourth studio album, The War , deepened the group's experimentation with genre, including the addition of trap music. With the album's single \" Ko Ko Bop \", Exo received praise for unconventionally hybridizing laid-back reggae sounds with heavy electronic breaks. Exo's members faced criticism early in their careers because of their lack of involvement in the writing and producing of their songs. However, in 2015 Exo released its first song to credit lyrics to one of the group's members, on the repackaged version of their second album, Love Me Right . \"Promise (Exo 2014)\" was written by Chanyeol, Chen, and Lay, and was a \"special gift\" to the fans, with lyrics thanking them for their support. Since then, Exo has released multiple songs with lyrics by the band's members, including \"Heaven\" and \"She's Dreaming\" from their third album, the special promotional single \"Lightsaber\", and most notably, the hit single \"Ko Ko Bop\" and several other songs from their 2017 album The War . In a 2017 interview with Billboard , Chanyeol spoke about his contributions to the lyrics for \"Chill\", stating that because he \"worked on the lyrics with an empty track without demo lyrics\", the process came more \"naturally\" to him. In the same interview, Chen explained the process of writing their single \"Ko Ko Bop\", saying \"[we] wrote the lyrics separately and worked on putting [them] together for the song afterwards. I don't think I have any regrets [about the song] since it's the best result produced through all the effort that our members and other writers have put into the process.\" Chen is also credited with writing the Korean lyrics for the track \"Lights Out\", from Exo's fourth special winter EP Universe . Lay is also a songwriter and producer, having written and composed each track of all his solo albums as well for other artists. Chanyeol participated in writing lyrics for \"Gravity\" and 'With You\", both off of Exo's sixth studio album Don't Mess Up My Tempo. Exo have been praised particularly for their synchronized choreography and elaborate stage designs. The band was choreographed early in their career by American hip hop choreographers Tony Testa and Nicholas Bass for songs like \"Wolf\" and \"Growl\", respectively. In recent years, Exo has collaborated with choreographer Kim Tae Woo. Dazed admired the band's \"seamless...knife-point choreography\", saying it has put Exo \"at the forefront of pop domination\". A recurring stage element during the group's world tours has been the use of water in the form of rain and shallow pools. Cleo said Exo's \"winning formula\" is the incorporation of water into their choreography, saying \"there was water cascading from above during 'White Noise' and 'Lightsaber', which saw some of the members getting drenched.\" Yahoo wrote that \"during one segment, the boys stood on an elevated hexagon-shaped stage (modeled after the band's logo), and danced sensually while water rained down on them from above.\" On their stage design, Music Mind noted Exo's use of \"not only ... the stage-lights and the lightsticks, but also [a] multitude of special effects like water, flames, and fireworks, not to mention huge screens positioned both on the substage and across the whole perimeter of the venue\". Rappler journalist Keb Cuevas described Exo's \"multi-LED screen stage fitted with holographic Exo embellishments and choreographed laser lighting\", saying \"the stage was literally on fire as pyrotechnic effects were ignited with the electronic beat.\" Covering a 2018 concert in Singapore, Bandwagon remarked that after their \"fourth headlining tour [in] four years ... you might [assume] their setlist and stages would be repetitive and stale. But [that] was not the case at all.\" With the release of their debut studio album in 2013, Exo became the first South Korean artists in 12 years to sell over one million copies of an album; the previous artist prior to reach this milestone was g.o.d , in 2001. In 2018, Exo became \"quintuple million sellers\", meaning the band has sold over one million copies apiece for five different albums. Following the release of their 5th studio album, Don't Mess Up My Tempo , Exo became the first South Korean artist who debuted in the 21st century to sell 10 million albums cumulatively. Exo have also contributed significantly to the financial success of their management agency, SM Entertainment. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Sm Entertainment recorded the largest ever quarterly profit for any South Korean entertainment company at $13.4 million. The SM artist generating the highest revenue was Exo, at 31% of the total $188 million fourth quarter revenue. Exo have been described as \"the biggest boy band in the world\". They have gained immense popularity in South Korea, and were named by Forbes on the Korea Power Celebrity list as the most powerful celebrities in South Korea for 2015 and 2016; within the top five for 2014, 2017, and 2018; and within the top 10 for 2019 They have been given a number of honorific nicknames such as \"Kings of K-Pop\" by international outlets Vogue , Metro , PageOne and South Korean outlets including OBS among others. They were also named as the \"Nation's pick\" and the \"Global pick\" by South Korean media. Exo are widely esteemed as a prominent force in the Hallyu Wave , which refers to the rise and spread of Korean pop culture around the world. When discussing the significance of Exo in a global context, Bustle magazine described them as \"the ultimate K-pop sensation\", saying \"there's really nothing quite like Exo.\" The group has received further attention for releasing almost all of its studio albums simultaneously in both Korean and Mandarin. Vulture described Exo as \"leaders of a K-pop generation\" when describing the band's ability to release music in the Korean and Chinese markets while continuing to impress in the United States with Billboard chartings and arena tours. In this regard, Dazed considered Exo's success to be that of \"a continent-straddling pop juggernaut\". In 2016, AsiaOne said \"Exo are turning into an omnipresent, unstoppable global force,\" citing their popularity in the United States, their critical acclaim, and the size of their global fandom. In April 2018, Forbes described Exo as one of the two artists worldwide that dramatically over-perform on social media, with the other being fellow K-pop boy band BTS . Both groups exceeded the reach of American artists such as Beyonce , Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift . Twitter statistics from Next Big Sound , show that with 24 million mentions in one week, Exo recorded 14,000 times more than expected. Exo also ranked at number two on the 2018 Billboard Social 50 end of year ranking. Exo's work has influenced numerous artists, including MVP , Kim Dong-han , NCT 127 , Wanna One , and Kang Daniel . Exo has maintained numerous endorsement deals throughout the group's career, and has been named multiple times as having the most powerful brand reputation among K-pop artists by the Korean Business Research Institute. Since 2012, Exo has maintained a partnership with Samsung , the largest public company in South Korea, where the group has endorsed the company's electronic products. In early February 2013, Exo began promoting the South Korean clothing brand Kolon Sport, for which they filmed a commercial for a new pair of sneakers named for their collaboration: MOVE-XO. Also in 2013, Exo began a two-year endorsement deal with cosmetics brand Nature Republic , which was later extended and remains active to this day. Their partnership grew in 2015 and 2016 to include autograph events, which drew 30,000 and 50,000 fans, respectively. The 2015 autograph event was held in Busan , with crowds such that the municipal police department tweeted: \"Currently live from Exo's fan signing in Gwangbukdong. One, two three! We Are One! Busan Police! Everyone, please be in order.\" These events were followed by the Green Nature Exo Fan Festival in 2017 and 2018; both were concert-style events hosted by Nature Republic with thousands of attendees. In late 2015, Exo officially endorsed Star Wars: The Force Awakens with the release of a collaboration film that featured \"the nine Exo members in a Star Wars-inspired world where clubs are 'Jedi Only' and they carry lightsabers\", according to Billboard . In 2016, the group became ambassadors for American footwear company Skechers , endorsing the D'Lites 2 Sweet Monster Collection. This partnership has extended to Skechers events such as the 2017 Sweet Monster K-Pop Dance Competition, attended by Exo members Chanyeol and Sehun. Also in 2016, the group became the official faces of international clothing brand SPAO's spring collection, which included limited-edition postcards and posters for customers. In 2018, in the lead-up to Exo's performance at the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Winter Olympics, the group became the faces of the Switzerland-based snow-sports company Kessler. In March 2018, Exo were announced to be the new brand ambassadors for Major League Baseball (MLB) in Asia. Following this announcement, Chanyeol, Kai, and Sehun attended the grand opening of the MLB store in Times Square , Hong Kong, on March 23. In July 2018, Exo were appointed as Korean Tourism Ambassadors for 2018 by the Korean Tourism Organization , and appeared in a series of promotional advertisements designed to \"promote Korea to the world\". Exo also maintain partnerships with, or have previously endorsed, companies including Coca-Cola , SK Telecom , KFC , MCM , Lotte Confectionery , Lotte World , Goobne Chicken, and Hats On. The members of Exo-K became goodwill ambassadors for South Korea's Red Cross Youth in December 2012. Members of Exo were appointed as official ambassadors for Fashion-KODE 2014, which was hosted by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and the Korea Active Content Agency Fashion Festival in July 2014. That same month, Samsung announced Exo as its brand ambassadors for the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics . Since its debut, Exo members have been involved in charity, such as volunteering for and making personal donations to organizations including childcare centers, the Korea Childhood Leukemia Foundation, Siheung Women's Resources Development Center, and China's Hunan province medical services. In 2015, Exo began participating in Smile For U, a joint SM Entertainment and UNICEF project that supports music education for children in Asia. Part of the proceeds from the band's second special winter release Sing for You and multiple subsequent albums were donated to the campaign. Exo have won numerous awards in South Korea and internationally. On June 14, 2013, the band earned their first-ever music show win, with the single \"Wolf\" on Korea's Music Bank . Music programs are weekly television shows in South Korea and China that award the artist with the most popular song in the country based on digital chart performance, album sales and social media popularity. Exo hold the record for the most music show wins for a single song, with 18 wins for \"Call Me Baby\", released in 2015. Exo have gone on to win over 100 music program awards, becoming the second act to do so after their label-mates Girls' Generation . Exo have also received 23 Daesang awards from various year-end award shows. In South Korea's music industry, a Daesang award is the \"grand prize\" of an award ceremony. These wins included six Daesang awards from the Mnet Asian Music Awards , which was recorded in the 2018 Guinness World Records book as the \"Most Daesang\" (grand prize) awards won at the Mnet Asian Music Awards. On November 3, 2017, Exo received a Prime Minister Commendation at the Korean Popular Culture and Arts Awards , an honor bestowed in recognition of public service and/or excellence in a given field. When receiving the award, Suho said: \"We have received such a big award alongside brilliant people ... It's such a huge honor. We will become performers who promote not only K-pop, but also Korea.\" "}

Before debut, D-Business confirmed that the group will increase and decrease the number of members at different times. The decision to keep the three member unit for \"Luv Me\" was due to the fact that the group saw \"Luv Me\" as a continuation of their debut, therefore felt it was necessary to keep the current line-up. However, no members were added in December. [ citation needed ] The group released a digital single \"Sleeping In (Part 2)\" , a remix of the song \"Sleeping In\" from their debut album.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon_Pop", "name": "Crayon Pop", "labels": ["Chrome Entertainment", "Sony Music", "Pony Canyon"], "intro": " Crayon Pop ( Hangul : \ud06c\ub808\uc6a9\ud31d) is a South Korean girl group formed under Chrome Entertainment in 2012. The group consists of four members: Geummi, Ellin, Choa, and Way. Their fifth member, Soyul, left the group in 2017. Crayon Pop officially debuted in July 2012 with their performance of \"Saturday Night\" on Mnet 's M! Countdown . Their first EP was not a commercial success, and when their song \"Dancing Queen\" was released in October, the group had few opportunities to promote on music shows . Instead they held guerrilla performances on the streets of Seoul, which helped increase their fanbase. Crayon Pop gained a huge increase in popularity following the release of their single album \" Bar Bar Bar \" in June 2013. The group's unique stage outfits and choreography gained public attention, and made the title song a viral hit. It eventually managed to reach number 1 on Billboard 's K-Pop Hot 100 . Crayon Pop was able to earn numerous awards, including the New Rising Star Award at the Golden Disk Awards , the Hot Trend Award at the MelOn Music Awards , and Best New Female Artist at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . The group has held solo concerts in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, and has also performed in other countries including Australia and China. Throughout June and July 2014, the group was an opening act Lady Gaga 's ArtRave: The Artpop Ball concert tour. Crayon Pop performed for it in 12 cities around the United States and Canada. Following their appearance in the Artpop tour, the group debuted their first subunit in October. The unit is named Strawberry Milk, and consists of the twin members Choa and Way. In March 2015, Crayon Pop released their second mini album FM , for which they used Super Sentai inspired costumes. They released the song \"RaRiRuRe\" in June of that same year, which was their debut in the Japanese music market. The group continued their Japanese promotions with their second single \"Dancing All Night\" in November. Their first Japanese studio album Crayon Pop was released January 2016, and it ranked #11 on Oricon's Daily Album Charts . Crayon Pop collaborated with Mexican boy band CD9 in August, to release the song \"Get Dumb\". In September, Crayon Pop released the song \"Vroom Vroom\" ahead of their first album Crayon Pop Evolution Pop Vol. 1 . They soon released the music video for \"Doo Doom Chit\", another song that would feature on the track list of the album. On 19 April 2017, the group announced their contracts with Chrome Media had ended in March and they had gone their separate ways, although they would not be officially disbanding. On 30 May, it was revealed that Way, Choa, Geummi and Ellin would continue to promote as Crayon Pop under Chrome Entertainment, but Soyul had chosen to leave the group. The group was initially named Hurricane Pop, and consisted of members Serang (Yang Se-hyeon), Geummi (Baek Bo-ram), Ellin (Kim Min-young), Choa (Heo Min-jin), and Soyul (Park Hye-kyeong). Chrome Entertainment's CEO, Hwang Hyun-chang, did not consider candidates who were taller than 165\u00a0cm or had a sexy image, because he wanted a group of ordinary girls. Soyul was the first member to be accepted, and Geummi was the next to join. Serang, under the name Mari, had formerly been the leader of the disbanded girl group Coin Jackson. Ellin was referred to Chrome Entertainment by Chrome's dance choreographer and was accepted after her third audition. Choa was recommended to the company by Way, her twin sister. Way had been invited to audition, but was unable to do so because she was a member of the indie band N.Dolphin. Singer Bumkey was involved in the audition process and also supervised the group's vocal training. The group recorded their first song 'Bing Bing' as Hurricane Pop. In January 2012, they performed the song live for the first time in Hangzhou , China. The performance of 'Bing Bing' was filmed for the Chinese television drama Curry Campus . A music video for their song was filmed in February, but Serang left the group in May to pursue an acting career. After Serang's departure, Way was given another chance to join the group and she left N.Dolphin. Shortly before their debut the group's name was changed to Crayon Pop, as Chrome Entertainment thought the name Hurricane Pop would be insensitive in light of Japan's tsunamis . The members' stage names were chosen by the company's CEO, although several of them had input into the choice. Crayon Pop began their promotions in Japan in May 2012, using their time there to film music videos for \"Bing Bing\". The group released both the Korean and Japanese music videos in June. The music video for their debut single \"Saturday Night\" was released on 17 July, followed by a Japanese version, as well as an alternate version with new footage, on 24 July. Crayon Pop's first EP , Crayon Pop 1st Mini Album , was released digitally on 18 July and included both \"Bing Bing\" and \"Saturday Night\". The group made their official stage debut the following day on 19 July, performing \"Saturday Night\" on Mnet 's M! Countdown . Crayon Pop's debut did not receive much attention and their album was not commercially successful. Chrome Entertainment's CEO later revealed that the album had depleted all the company's money. Crayon Pop released a digital single album, \"Dancing Queen\", on 24 October 2012. Besides the title track, it also included a remixed version of \"Bing Bing\". In order to stand out from other girl groups, Crayon Pop wore tracksuits instead of more feminine clothing. After seeing a performance of \"Dancing Queen\", Kangin and Shindong of Super Junior praised the song and group, with Shindong saying \"I'd love to produce a girl group like them\". Crayon Pop was only invited to perform on music shows three times, and they were not able to have a typical promotion cycle. As a result, they took to the streets and promoted \"Dancing Queen\" with guerrilla performances, which often took place in extremely cold weather. Chrome Entertainment also produced a reality web series about the group, titled Crayon Pop TV . Through these activities, Crayon Pop developed a loyal fanbase, especially of \"uncle fans\" called \"Pop-jeossi\" (from the Korean word ajeossi ). Crayon Pop returned to Japan and held a mini-concert on 6 January 2013 in Shibuya, Tokyo . Tickets went on sale on 11 December 2012, and sold out in less than an hour. As a result of considerable demand from fans unable to purchase tickets, Chrome Entertainment announced that another Japanese concert would be held at a later date, and a second mini-concert was staged in Osaka on 22 February. On 25 January, Crayon Pop began promoting the remixed version of \"Bing Bing\", which included a popping dance break to Daft Punk 's \" Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger \" instead of the original rap verse. They had a \"delinquent schoolgirl\" concept with new choreography, and wore tracksuits or school uniforms with tracksuit pants. On 19 May, a third Japanese mini-concert was held in Shibuya, Tokyo. A new Japanese member, Arisa, was to be revealed at this concert, but she had withdrawn from the group before the performance. On 8 June, Crayon Pop performed a preview version of their new song \" Bar Bar Bar \". The unusual dance featured choreographed jumping, and they wore scooter helmets, polo shirts, and tracksuit pants with skirts. A story version music video was released on 13 June, a week before the song's digital release on 20 June. Three days later, a dance version music video was released. Filmed with a budget of only 380,000 won (US$347), the music video went viral and Crayon Pop drew interest due to their unique stage outfits and choreography. This music video has more than 51 million views on YouTube as of April 2019. As \"Bar Bar Bar\" went viral, it began to climb the Korean digital music charts, eventually reaching the upper positions of most major real time chart listings. It stayed at the top of Billboard 's Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart for more than a month, and ranked number 1 for the first time eight weeks after release. \"Bar Bar Bar\" solidified its viral status when a parody video was aired on a segment of SNL Korea on 13 August. That same day, it was announced that Crayon Pop had signed a contract with Sony Music Entertainment , who were inspired by the groups' creativity and uniqueness and saw their global market potential. Crayon Pop scored their first music show win when \"Bar Bar Bar\" won first place on Music Bank on 30 August, beating EXO 's \" Growl \". On 9 September, a \"Global Version\" music video was released ahead of Crayon Pop's second mini album, The Streets Go Disco , which was released on 26 September under the Sony Music label. This album consisted of their four previous singles and remixes of those songs. A music video for the title track, \"Dancing Queen 2.0\", was released along with the album. \"Bar Bar Bar\" earned Chrome Entertainment US$2 million in the year after its release, and Crayon Pop was able to move from their small row house in Nonhyeon-dong to a luxury \"villa\" apartment due to their increased income. Crayon Pop's rising popularity also brought them criticism. Netizens accused the group of being affiliated with the right-wing website Ilbe after Way used the phrase nomu nomu (\ub178\ubb34\ub178\ubb34) on Twitter. This phrase was popularized on Ilbe and was used to criticize former president Roh Moo-hyun . It was then discovered that Chrome Entertainment's CEO previously mentioned the website on Twitter. CEO Hwang responded by saying he was registered on many popular online communities, including Ilbe, in order to gather information about singers and girl groups. He also stated that Way's phrase was an example of aegyo and she was not even aware of the website. However, the controversy continued and several of the group's scheduled events were cancelled after criticism from the public. Online auction company Auction stopped broadcasting its new TV commercial featuring Crayon Pop after widespread customer complaints. The controversy resurfaced in January 2014 after Ellin allegedly used the Ilbe hand sign, but Chrome Entertainment explained that Ellin was forming the letter \"E\" with her hand, and all the Crayon Pop members have alphabet hand signs that signify their names. Due to Crayon Pop's increased popularity, they had more opportunities to perform. On 27 July, they held their first mini-concert in South Korea.

On 1 February 2017, Chrome Entertainment released a statement discussing Crayon Pop's impending contract expirations, announcing their contracts would expire in March and they had previously not discussed the issue of re-signing with the company.

While disbandment was not confirmed, the members would be focusing on their solo careers, in effect putting the group on indefinite hiatus. Chrome Entertainment later released a statement contradicting this, saying Way's contract ended in May, not in March as previously stated. On 8 May, it was confirmed that although both parties had repeatedly denied the rumours of a pregnancy and shotgun marriage, Soyul was pregnant and would be giving birth to a girl the same month. On 31 May, an announcement was made that Geummi, Ellin, Choa and Way signed a non-exclusive contract under Chrome Entertainment to promote as Crayon Pop, however their solo careers would be managed by other labels.

All of them, with the exception of Ellin, were featured on KBS2's The Return of Superman , where Soyul's family are regular cast members. Crayon Pop's music is often described as electropop and disco-pop dance music with addictive and repetitive lyrics and melodies. Their first single, \"Saturday Night\", was a 1980s -inspired \"electro-pop dance song with a retro melody\". After the release of \"Bar Bar Bar\", Corynn Smith of MTV called Crayon Pop \"a disco-pop K-Pop group that is obviously having a blast\" with \"bafflingly simple lyrics and unexpected choreography.\" Pops in Seoul described \" Lonely Christmas \" as \"a dance song with funk and disco sounds\", while Billboard magazine noted the song's catchy hook and energetic synths, trumpets and guitars. Crayon Pop's sixth single, \"Uh-ee\", is a mix of electronic sounds and trot . Chrome Entertainment called the genre \" house electronic trot\" because it \"is composed of fast beats and strong electronic sounds with addictive trot melody\". Billboard described the song as having a hyper- techno dance beat that would fit into Dance Dance Revolution , while the dance routine was \"more like an intense aerobic workout than a silly dance\". Strawberry Milk ( Korean : \ub538\uae30 \uc6b0\uc720 ; RR : Ttalgiuyu ) is Crayon Pop's first subgroup, featuring twins Choa and Way. Chrome Entertainment announced the subgroup (also called a unit or sub-unit) on 29 September 2014. Their debut album, The 1st Mini Album , was released on 15 October, along with a music video for the title track, \"OK\". Another song on the album, \"Let Me Know\", was written by Way.

The sisters also played two of the lead roles in the music video. On 13 January 2016, the sisters released the single \"I Hate You\" (\ub098\uac00 \ubbf8\uc6cc).

The group's name stems from the idea that each member is reminiscent of a different type of chocolate . The name of the group was initially going to be \"Chocolate\", but there was already a group with that name, so Paramount Music decided to use the French word chocolat instead. The group consists of mixed race members. The group became inactive in 2013. Melanie confirmed in an interview that the group members' contracts had concluded in February 2017 and the group had disbanded. On August 2, 2011, Chocolat was revealed to the public by Paramount Music as the first mixed race group to debut in South Korea. Prior to their debut, their music had been described as electronic club music, a mix of the disco of T-ara 's \" Roly-Poly \" and the club sounds of 2NE1 's \"I Am The Best\". They have also said their role models are from girl group 2NE1. The song \"I Like It\" was brought to the group at the last-minute by the Paramount's president, thinking that it better represented the group's image. At this point, the band had already recorded seven songs and were rehearsing another song for their debut. At first, the song was not well-liked, but public reception made them more comfortable with it. The music video for \"Syndrome\" was released on August 16, prior to the release of the digital single. Following the digital release of the single on August 17, Chocolat had their debut performance on Mnet's M! Countdown on August 18, 2011, later performing on August 19, 2011 on KBS Music Bank , on August 20, 2011 on MBC Music Core and finally a week later on SBS Inkigayo , on September 4, 2011.

Promotions for \"I Like It\" began on December 3, 2011 at the music show K-pop Con . Due to severe illness, member Jaeyoon was unable to attend recording sessions for the title track and therefore had to miss the \"I Like It\" promotional period altogether. The EP contains a total of five songs, including the title track \"I Like It\", which is work of Girls' Generation 's Genie 's songwriters Anne Judith Wik, Robin Jenssen, Ronny Svendsen and Nermin Harambasic . Writer team DWB, having previously composed their debut single, composed the EP's track \"In a Heartbeat\" (\ub108\ub9cc\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0 \ub108\ub9cc\uc744 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub294) and \"World Domination\" (\uc2eb\uc5b4 \uc2eb\uc5b4). The EP was released on December 15, 2011, including their title track \"I Like It\", an English version of the single, and three other tracks, likely to have been amongst the seven previously recorded songs the group had prior to debuting.

On January 5, it was announced that Chocolat had been chosen as new models for NBA Korea.

The first performance for \"One More Day\" was broadcast through KBS 's Music Bank on February 3. The music video was then released on February 9, 2012, alongside the physical and digital single album, which included the title track, a B-side song titled \"Get Up\", as well as instrumentals of both songs.

The group has since been a four-membered unit, as their former main vocalist Jaeyoon continued her absence from activities.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_B", "name": "Block B", "labels": ["Stardom", "Seven Seasons"], "intro": "Block B ( Korean : \ube14\ub77d\ube44 ) is a South Korean boy band created by Cho PD in 2011. The group debuted with seven members: Taeil , B-Bomb , Jaehyo , U-Kwon , Park Kyung , Zico , and P.O . In February 2011, Cho PD announced that he would be spending $1.4 million USD to create a seven-member hip hop group under his \"Creating Korea's Eminem Project\". On April 13, 2011, their debut music video for \"Freeze!\" was released, but banned by the Commission of Youth Protection because they felt that it was too sexy for Korean television. As a result, the song could not be sold to minors under the age of 19, and the video could not be aired before 10 pm. On April 15, 2011, Block B made their live debut on KBS Music Bank . The group followed up with another track, \"Wanna B\". A mini album, New Kids on the Block , was released on June 23, 2011. On June 22, 2011, the first episode of MTV's eight-episode series Match Up! was aired featuring Block B and B1A4 . On October 16, 2011 MTV started airing a series of specials for the Match Up series that followed Block B as they promoted in Japan. Welcome to the Block , their second mini album, ran into some controversy: two songs from the album were banned as inappropriate for minors by The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (MOGEF) and KBS. In February 2012, Block B came under fire for behaving inappropriately during an interview that had taken place in Thailand a month earlier. They made offensive remarks regarding the flood disaster that was taking place and were criticized by other celebrities and the media. In response, the members issued letters of apology and released a video on their record company's YouTube channel. As result of this incident, leader of Block B, Zico, also shaved his head to demonstrate his remorse. Block B returned in October 2012 with their first full-length album, Blockbuster . The title track \"Nillili Mambo\" was well received and ranked number 10 on Billboard' s World Albums Chart. On January 3, it was reported that Block B had filed a suit against their agency to ask for their exclusive contract to be nullified. According to media reports, the Block B members filed against Stardom at the Seoul Central District Court, stating, \"During the signing of the exclusive contract, it was promised that in addition to providing proper training opportunity and facilities, we would be paid on every 25th of the following month\u2026However, the agency has not paid us for nearly one year since April 2011.\" (It's not clear whether it is 2011 or 2012 since the quote in the article states that it is nearly a year, but April 2011 would be well over a year). \"It started last year in March when one member's contract was ended and his portion of the pay was calculated\u2026 Appearance fees from events as well as pay from SBS drama 'Phantom's OST, MBC drama 'Golden Time' OST, and funds collected from the inauguration of our Japanese fan site's fan club, and more for a total of 10 things, have been omitted.\" They added, \"The CEO of the agency, Mr. Lee, has also disappeared with the 70,000,000 KRW (~66,000 USD) that he collected from the members' parents.\" On May 20, 2013, it was reported that Mr. Lee had committed suicide. On June 7, 2013, the court ruled in favour of the company, saying \"It's difficult to see the company not being able to pay the group as intentional. From the evidence provided so far, it is difficult to claim that the label purposely did not pay Block B. It is also difficult to say that the label did not provide proper facilities such as studios and dorms, and it is also difficult to say that they did not provide education and guidance. From written records, it cannot be said that Stardom Entertainment violated their management obligations. There is a possibility that the musical income of 430,000,000 KRW (approximately $385,000 USD) and the event income of 5,000,000 KRW (approximately $4,500 USD) was not properly taken care of. However, from just the evidence provided, it cannot be said that the label purposely kept the money from the members.\" Block B issued a statement in response to the ruling, apologising to fans and saying they would no longer be working with Stardom Entertainment. The group also said that they would be contesting the ruling, and were preparing independent promotions. On August 29, 2013, Block B announced that they had negotiated the transfer of their rights from Stardom to a new management company, Seven Seasons. A representative from Seven Seasons said that the group was planning to release a new album in October. Seven Seasons created a YouTube channel on which they uploaded Block B videos.

Following that was Jaehyo and P.O 's teaser released on September 4, showing the two suiting up. That teaser also ended with the question: \"Do you wanna B?\" On September 17, 2013, Block B announced their pre-released single via Seven Seasons' YouTube channel. The single \"Be the Light\" featured Taeil's singing voice with a short clip of their music video accompanying it. The full video was released September 22, 2013.

During the showcase, leader Cho-Rong stated that Pink Revolution would incorporate a new sense of Apink's growth and maturity since debut, while Eun-ji explained that Apink will begin to focus on making complex and beautiful music, rather than tracks that \"are simply fun and catchy.\" Apink promoted \"Only One\" and Pink Revolution for nearly a month, and the album has since sold 50,000+ copies in South Korea. In November 2016, Apink began their \"Pink Aurora\" Asia Tour, performing at numerous destinations throughout eastern Asia including Taiwan and Singapore.

Once again, Apink worked with common collaborator Black Eyed Pilseung for the title track, who had previously produced \"Only One\". With this comeback, Apink took on a different direction conceptually, with a bolder image and a more sophisticated sound. \"I'm So Sick\" topped several music charts in South Korea after its release. The album itself topped the Gaon chart and led Apink to reach their highest-ever position on Billboard's World Albums chart at No. 11. The success of the song and album further led to Apink making their debut on Billboard's Social 50 chart, opening at No. 39. Billboard have chosen the title track as one of 20 Best K-Pop Songs of 2018, noting that \"it felt a bit meta -- as the six-member girl group swapped out their girlish image for something far more compelling.\". In August, Apink embarked on another Asia tour, visiting Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Singapore, Tokyo and Taipei. On December 1, Apink received the Top 10 Artists award at the MelOn Music Awards for their song \"I'm So Sick\".

On January 7, Apink released their eighth mini album Percent , along with the single \"%%(Eung Eung)\", composed by frequent collaborator Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Goon. The single, which continued the new direction taken by the group with \"I'm So Sick\", topped several music charts in South Korea after its release and peaked at No. 17 on the Gaon digital chart, while the album reached No. 3 on the Korean chart and No. 14 on the Billboard World Albums chart. To promote the new album, Apink performed \"%%(Eung Eung)\" on various music shows, along with B-side track \"Hug Me\", for a period of two weeks beginning on January 9. On March 13, 2020, Play M Entertainment announced that Apink would be making a comeback some time in April. Apink's image and music style are often compared to first-generation idol girl groups S.E.S. and Fin.K.L . Apink has an innocent and girlish image, unusual among girl groups' sexy concepts. In 2012, member Oh Ha-young said, \"Other girl groups these days tend to highlight their dancing skills and sexy looks, but our concept was an innocent and pure image. I think that's why the audience felt comfortable with us\". However, with releases like 2014's \" Luv \" and 2015's \" Remember \" group deviated, and showed a more mature and sensitive side to the group while still retaining their trademark innocence. Apink's music generally fits within the bubblegum pop genre, with signature cheery lyrics. Jeff Benjamin of Billboard commented that \" My My \" recalled early 2000s bubblegum pop, \" NoNoNo \" was influenced by 1980s synth-pop and \" Luv \" recalls 1990s hip-hop while blending it with ballad melancholy, a fall-themed song of lost love. \" Mr Chu \", released in spring 2014, continues a slew of Apink's trademark bubblegum series which is 'very Apink'. Meanwhile, title track \" Remember \" is a 'cheery synth-pop tune that reminisces about a love during the summertime,' and 'features a quick rhythm and vintage sound to beat the summer heat,'. Their 2016 title track, \" Only One \" is described as mature, blending in mid tempo R&B and dance-pop with subtle hip-hop beats while song like \" Boom Pow Love \" shows a far more urban-pop, energetic vibe with pulsing beats compared to their previous hits. With the release of 2018's \"I'm So Sick\", Apink showed a shift in their style of music, moving towards a more mature and sophisticated sound. The track, with its use of autotune, synth and house beats, and its lyrical content of having 'not even one' bit of feeling left for an ex, makes \"I'm So Sick\" a much bolder track than what Apink is known to put out. 2019's \"%%(Eung Eung)\" does much of the same. Its use of 'izzy snyths, snapping beats, and slapping percussion as the members sing about the type of person one should love' make\u00a0%%(Eung Eung) another song that is a departure from much of Apink's earlier work. Korean Tours Japan Tours Asia Tours American Tours Apink started with a documentary program titled Apink News , which aired on the cable channel TrendE for three seasons (2011\u20132012).

In mid-2009, Jaejoong , Yoochun and Junsu (then-members of group TVXQ) filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment , arguing that the 13-year length and structure of their exclusive contracts as well as the terms of profit distribution were unilaterally disadvantageous towards the artists and should be invalidated. The Seoul Central District Court in October 2009 ruled in their favor affirming their right to independently engage in entertainment activities and granted them injunction suspending the SM contracts; its ruling emphatically pointed out it was a \"subjugating contract\" with terms that are grossly incompatible with Korean labor and contract law. The three members of JYJ continued their activities in Japan for over half a year after the filing of the injunction until their Japanese agency, Avex, unilaterally suspended their activities in 2010 and gave its support to the remaining two members of the original group.

In September 2012, the final decision on the case was postponed indefinitely by Seoul Central District Court for mediation under the justice department. On 28 November 2012, during a voluntary arbitration at the Seoul Central District Court, SM Entertainment and JYJ reached a mutual agreement to terminate all contracts between the two parties and not to interfere with each other's activities in the future. This concluded the three years and four months long exclusive contract lawsuit in Korea.

Avex has filed for an appeal. On 16 February 2014, C-JeS Entertainment and AVEX's long legal battle has been resolved.
