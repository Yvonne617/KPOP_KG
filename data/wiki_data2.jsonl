They debuted as Rania with their debut single album Teddy Riley, The First Expansion In Asia with title track \"Dr Feel Good\" released in April 2011. Rania was originally set to debut in mid 2010 as the third generation of Baby V.O.X. , however their record company DR Music decided to rebrand them as a new group named Rania with eight members: Saem (later known as Yina), Lucy (later known as Jooyi), Riko, Joy, Di, T-ae, Xia and Sarah. T-ae, Riko and Yina were chosen to star alongside former 2PM member Jay Park in his movie Hype Nation, causing DR Music to push back the group's debut. At the beginning of 2011, Sarah Wang made her decision to leave the group and was replaced by Chinese trainee Yijo. Before the addition of Yijo, Thai Korean trainee Data (Song Daeun) and Canadian Korean trainee Minhee (Moon Minhee) were set to take Sarah's place. However, Minhee left due to parental disapproval due to her age (at the time she was 15), and Data left due to homesickness (her family resided in Thailand). Rania made their debut in April 2011 as an eight-member group, consisting of Saem, Jooyi, Riko, Joy, Di, T-ae, Xia and Yijo. However, upon their debut EP's release, Yijo was not present for live performances. It was later revealed that Yijo was having issues with her work visa. She left the group shortly after. On April 6 they performed on KBS ' Music Bank , with the title track \"Dr Feel Good\", composed by producer Teddy Riley . The song was originally given to Lady Gaga . However, since their music video and live performances caused controversy in Korea as some viewers felt that their image and concept were too provocative, Rania were forced to change their choreography and make minor changes to the outfits. After the conclusion of \"Dr Feel Good\" promotions, the group returned in June with their first digital single \"Masquerade\" (also composed by Riley). Despite having planned an American debut, the group made no advancements. Shortly afterwards Riley announced that he would have nothing more to do with the group after falling out with their record label, releasing a statement saying \"I wish them the best. It's not the girls I dislike, I love Rania, they would be better with me at SM Entertainment. Their manager does shady business, used me for my music. I love Rania, I just don't like their company business. That's why they are not getting bigger. They don't do business upfront. They used my name every where then back door me on the group. It's ok if they will regret it. If they leave that company, I will sign them up quickly. Please know the facts before attacking me. Attack their company. Such great talent will be wasted if they don't get better support.\" The group released their second EP, Time to Rock Da Show , on November 16, 2011. The music video for its title track, \"Pop Pop Pop\", written by Brave Brothers , was revealed four days later. Joy suddenly went on hiatus at this time, which DR Music claimed was because her parents' house had been affected in the flood which occurred in Thailand at the time of the release, and later left Rania in June 2012. In a series of now-deleted tweets, she wrote \"To everyone, I'm sorry I let you guys down so many times, but I\u2019ve been thinking about it for months. I think I can't go back to stand on that place anymore. [...] I can't go back anymore. Thanks for all of your love and all of your hope, thank you so much and I feel so sorry that I [am disappointing beloved fans]\u2026From now\u2026I think I can't be in the entertainment [industry] or back to be a singer anymore since I was sick\u2026But I haven't got any confidence to go back to do it. I'm sorry that I made you all have to wait for me\u2026and I made you all feel confused. Thank you so much for gifts, kindness, love that you give me. Thank you.\" On 30 May 2012, Rania performed a new song named \"Killer\" at the Dream Concert. They made a comeback on September 16 with second digital single \"Style\", whose music video was revealed on September 20. Jooyi did not participate in this comeback, although DR Music claimed she was still a member of the group. Rania released the lead single \"Just Go\" on March 8, 2013, along with their third mini album, also titled Just Go (Goodbye's The New Hello) . They also announced to debut in America in summer 2013. Empire Records was to be handling the girls' distribution while Fireworks was to handle their American management. Larry Rudolph and Adam Leber , two of Britney Spears ' managers, decided to be Rania's managers throughout their U.S. promotions. Starting May 21, Rania began filming for their MTV reality show Road to Fame in Los Angeles and other cities across the U.S. The show would feature the group's preparations for their U.S. debut and would air for three months. It was also revealed that the album would feature collaborations with both Snoop Dogg and 2 Chainz . However, Rania's American debut was delayed again in June. Instead, they began to film a CF for Woongjin Waterpark Play\u00b0C and released a special digital single titled \"Up\" for fans on July 5. In May 2014, the group signed with Spanish label INGENIOmedia and confirmed they would have a comeback in July with \"Acceleration\", with a second round of promotions in September. The label also confirmed that they were looking for a sixth member to replace Riko, who was absent from the group since \"Just Go\". Following an incident where a staffer at INGENIOmedia leaked Rania's comeback track to a sasaeng fan , the company severed ties with the group, stating they were \"taking too long\". INGENIOMedia later released a statement saying that they were not looking for a member to replace Riko, apologizing for any confusion, and said that any news on member changes would have to come from Rania's company. In late 2014, Saem stopped attending public events and deactivated her official social media accounts. This led to intense fan speculation that she had left the group, but DR Music did not release an official statement regarding her situation. Soon afterwards, DR Music announced Riko's departure, releasing a statement saying: \"After the completion of the promotions of the single \"Style\", Riko told us with that she would take her university entrance exams to study a career, she asked for a three year break to complete her university studies and once she graduated from college, she could return to the group as a member of RaNia, but the problem came back this year when she reproached subjects in the university, she made us aware of this situation and asked for a year more absence that we found impossible since although she promotes or not with the group, we as a company should continue paying a normal salary, And That is unfair for us and the other members of the group, because she can not postpone her absence anymore, she decided to leave the group and the agency.\" DR Music later added a new member, Sharon Park, who was a model before joining the group. In January 2015, Jooyi stopped attending live performances with RaNia. When asked for an update on the situation, DR Music claimed that she was simply on hiatus. In April 2015, Sharon Park left the group to focus on her modeling career. In July 2015, the group made their appearance with two new members, trainees Seulji and Hyeme. In October 2015, they were announced to be having a comeback as a six-member group on November 6 with their third EP Demonstrate . On 3 November, Seulji and Hyeme were revealed as new members and it was announced that Demonstrate would feature African-American rapper Alexandra Reid, with the possibility of her becoming a new member of the group. On November 4, DR Music confirmed that Alexandra Reid had joined the group, while confirming Saem and Jooyi's departures. Alex is the first African-American woman to be an official member of a South Korean girl group. DR Music sent out a letter to fans that supported their Makestar project, informing them that RaNia's comeback had been pushed back to August 2016, and they were working on a Hyeme & Alex sub-unit instead. On July 13, 2016, however, Makestar announced that due to repeated failed attempts to contact DR Music about the project's progress and \"the continued irresponsible behavior and stance taken by the RaNia project creator, and our unwillingness to ignore the inconvenience this is causing to the project participants\", the project would be terminated and all money returned to the fans. On May 26, it was confirmed that the last three original members of RaNia - Di, T-ae and Xia had withdrawn from the group and parted ways from DR Music after five years. They then signed with their new label Enter Hama, where they announced their plans to redebute as \"Ela8te\", although these plans fell through. On June 26, RaNia performed at a Chinese event with three DR Music trainees: Jian, Jieun (a former member of LPG ) and Crystal. On August 15, 2016, Alex announced that she was the group's new leader. On October 25, RaNia performed with two DR Music trainees (Ttabo and Hyeonji) at the 2016 Seoul ICARUS Drone International Film Festival. Two days later DR Music stated that from seven DR Music trainees they would choose new RaNia members. On December 23, 2016, DR Music revealed a teaser image for \"BP RaNia\" (\"Black Pearl\" RaNia, in reference to Alex's darker skintone) and hinted a comeback as a seven-member group. On December 24, an image teaser for Hyeme and new member Jieun were revealed. On 25 December, Zi.U (formerly known as Seulji) and new member Yumin teaser images were revealed. On December 26, DR Music revealed teaser images for Alex and new Chinese member Ttabo.

On December 27, DR Music revealed last teaser image for Saem, confirming that she had re-joined the group. On December 28, RaNia released their first teaser music video for their upcoming comeback track \"Start a Fire\" as BP RaNia. \"Start a Fire\" was released on December 30, 2016, along with their fourth EP of the same name. DR Music said \"Through Spanish company INGENIOmedia, the song will be available in more than 60 countries around the world.\" On February 10 2017, DR Music announced that BP RaNia would start promotions for their second song \"Make Me Ah\" from the Start a Fire EP, on February 14. It was also announced that this would be the first time that Alex would take part in the entire choreography. On February 21, DR Music revealed that the company was approached by a well established production company with an acting opportunity for Alex, to which they responded by releasing a statement saying that they hoped that fans could understand the benefits of this opportunity, and that the opportunity would \"allow the group to gain exposure and help BP RaNia's success by expanding their fan base.\" DR Music assured the fans that Alex would remain a fully active member of BP RaNia, and would return to her regular schedules after her return to Korea. The company asked people to send positivity to Alex and to wait patiently and enthusiastically for their return. On February 28, RaNia released their first compilation album RaNia Legends , comprising songs from \"Dr Feel Good\" to \"Start a Fire\". On May 12, DR Music announced that they were looking for three to four new members to start BP RaNia W, a worldwide group that would promote alongside the current members of BP RaNia. Near the end of March fans noticed that Yina was absent from group promotions, to which DR Music replied that Yina was busy with her own individual activities. On June 8, Yina announced in an Instagram post that she was leaving BP RaNia. The agency later confirmed that Yina had decided to focus on her acting career. BP RaNia remained as a six-membered group, releasing their seventh EP Refresh 7th on August 12, with title track \"Beep Beep Beep\". Promotions became controversial when fans noticed that Alex had very few lines, and in fact spent the majority of performances standing off to the side while the other girls danced and sang. On August 19, DR Music announced that Alex had left the group, and that the group would continue promotions as five. Following her departure, Alex took to Twitter and criticized the company in regards to how she was treated and her departure, saying \"People think they can push you around, take advantage of you, manipulate you, violate you then throw you in the trash and walk. Dead wrong.\" On September 13, it was announced that the group would be making a comeback with \"Breathe Heavy\" from their Refresh 7th EP. In January 2018, after fans noticed that Ttabo had missed several appearances with the group, DR Music issued a statement stating she was filming a movie in China. On May 31, DR Music announced the departure of Yumin from the group due to her having \"recently been faced with circumstances that make it increasingly hard for her to follow the extremely demanding team schedule\". It was also announced that the group would be having a comeback in June and releasing a \"Best Of\" album in August, but neither event occurred. On June 28, it was announced that a new member named Namfon had joined the group. She made her first appearance on RaNia's Malaysia tour. On July 17, former member Yumin was announced to be marrying former Topp Dogg member P-Goon. In February 2019, Yumin revealed that following the birth of their son, she and P-Goon had separated, and she was raising the baby herself. On November 7, when asked via SNS by fans if she was still a member Ttabo stated that she is a \u201cformer idol\u201d, and following the discovery that every remaining member of the group had removed \"RaNia\" from their social media accounts and that the company had unfollowed some of the members, rumours began to circulate that DR Music as a company had gone bankrupt and was unable to continue operations, resulting in an unofficial disbandment. On August 18, 2019, RaNia announced via their official Instagram account that they would be performing in Romania from September 4\u20135 with three unconfirmed members. Fans began speculating that this meant Zi.U and Jieun had left the group. On August 28, the group's official YouTube account uploaded a video confirming the Romania performance as well as revealing the three new members as Seunghyun, Larissa, and ex- Stellar member Youngheun, as well as confirming departures of Jieun, Zi.U and Ttabo. On January 25, 2020, Namfon was announced to have left the group, bringing the group's total number of former members to 14. It was also revealed that the group has had no further activities since the performance in Romania. On February 18, Namfon spoke with a fansite and alleged that DR Music did not care about the group, and expressed her hopes that the other members would be able to leave as quickly as possible. In March, Larissa was revealed to have returned to her home country of Brazil, and fans noticed she had \"liked\" a fan comment on RaNia's official instagram that said the company \"should just let the group die in peace\", as well as liking several other comments with the same sentiment.

The group was composed of eleven members: Kim Yo-han , Kim Woo-seok , Han Seung-woo, Song Hyeong-jun, Cho Seung-youn , Son Dong-pyo, Lee Han-gyul, Nam Do-hyon, Cha Jun-ho, Kang Min-hee and Lee Eun-sang. The group debuted on August 27, 2019 with the single \"Flash\" under Swing Entertainment and was co-managed by Stone Music Entertainment . Despite a successful debut, X1's career was mired by the Mnet vote manipulation investigation , and after an unsuccessful negotiation about the group's future between the members' individual agencies, they disbanded on January 6, 2020. The group's name, X1, was suggested by netizens through the official Produce X 101 website and chosen by CJ E&M , with the name taken from the show's title song \"X1-MA\". X1 means \"11\" in Roman numbers, and also represents 10 members + 1 member who received the 'X' rank. [ citation needed ] On August 19, X1 released their fandom name, \"One It\". The name \"One It\" has two meanings: the first, \"want it\" like how the members wish to achieve their goals, and second, how their fans are the one thing most important to X1. X1 was formed through the survival competition series Produce X 101 , which aired on Mnet from May 3, 2019, until July 19, 2019. Out of an initial 101 trainees participating, the final 10 were chosen out of the remaining 20 trainees in the final week of the show. The final member, known as the rank X member, was selected from the remaining trainees based on the highest number of cumulative votes. All members were announced via the final episode, which was broadcast live on July 19, 2019. Prior to the program, many of the members have already been active in the music industry. Cho Seung-youn debuted as a member of Uniq in 2014. He also debuted as a solo artist and music producer under the stage name Luizy in 2016, before changing it to WOODZ in 2018. He is known for producing the Idol Producer debut evaluation song \"It's Ok\". Kim Woo-seok debuted in UP10TION under the name Wooshin in September 2015, in which he was also the host of SBS MTV 's The Show alongside Produce 101 season 1 contestant & former I.O.I member Jeon So-mi in 2016.

Lee Han-gyul previously debuted as a member of Yama and Hotchicks Entertainment's ballad group IM and competed with his fellow IM members in KBS2 's The Unit where he ended up in 13th place. Fellow MBK trainee Nam Do-hyon was a contestant in MBC 's Under Nineteen as a member of the Rap Team and was ended up in 42nd place on the show. Their contract was intended for 5 years after debut, with a 2.5-year exclusive contract and another 2.5-year non-exclusive contract, meaning that the individual members can return to co-promote with their original agencies after the first half of their contract is over. After the program, the Top 11 contestants debuted under Stone Music 's Swing Entertainment , the label which housed the second season Produce 101 Season 2 winner Wanna One . However, following a civil lawsuit filed against Mnet due to Produce X 101' s vote manipulation allegations , several brands cancelled their endorsement deals with X1 or put them on hold. Some of the agencies of the contestants refused to sign until the allegations cleared up. In spite of this, X1's debut proceeded as planned. Ahead of debut, the group's reality show X1 Flash premiered on August 22, 2019 through Mnet. The reality show follows the members as they prepare for their debut, and gives a glimpse into their real lives. The group debuted on August 27, 2019 with a debut showcase at Gocheok Sky Dome . On August 1, it was announced that the debuting album is Emergency: Quantum Leap with title song \"Flash\", composed by Score, Megatone and Onestar (Monotree). On September 3, X1 won their first-ever music show win through SBS MTV 's The Show one week after debut.

On November 5, 2019, Ahn Joon-young, the producer of Produce X 101 , was arrested, and he later admitted that all eleven members had been selected before the end of the show. This affected X1's image and caused several public appearances to be cancelled. Mnet announced that there were currently no plans for the group to promote. On December 30, 2019, CJ ENM announced that members and their agencies were in discussions on the group's future. On January 6, 2020, CJ ENM, Swing Entertainment, and the members' individual agencies held a meeting to determine the future of the group. After deliberating for an hour about whether the group should continue promoting or disband, a secret ballot was held by the members' agencies. The agencies agreed prior to voting that the group could only continue if there was unanimous agreement or else the group would disband. Four agencies voted to continue, four agencies voted to disband, and one agency whose vote was unclear was ultimately discarded. Thus, it was determined that the group would disband. Although X1 members were not invited to the meeting, Swing CEO Cho Yoo-myung expressed their collective desire to have attended. After the group's disbandment was decided, CJ ENM suggested that a previously recorded winter track be released as a goodbye song, but the idea was rejected by two or three of the members' agencies. Similarly, a suggestion from a member's agency to record a final video was rejected by another agency. Prior to debut, X1 made their Billboard chart debut on the charts Social 50 and Emerging Artists at No. 6 and No. 11, making them the first Korean artists to land a spot on the Social 50 prior to debut. X1 has sold over 500,000 physical copies of their EP in first week of sales, hence broke the record for having the highest first week sales for a debut album, which was a record that was previously set by solo artist, Kang Daniel with his debut album, Color On Me.\n"}

On May 17, it was reported that their new mini-album was to be released in late June. It was also revealed that a new member could possibly join the line-up with their new release.

This theme was confirmed by both the tags used for the teaser images on social media and in a radio interview starring Stellar. On August 22, it was announced that the group would be holding a special anniversary concert titled \"Interstellar: Time Travel Through 6 Years\" on August 28. On August 23, it was confirmed that Gayoung and Jeonyul would leave Stellar at the end of the month after they decided not to renew their contracts with The Entertainment Pascal. On August 25, Stellar announced the addition of a new member, Youngheun.

On February 22, 2018, the members posted to social media about how they had arranged a \"final\" fan meeting for the group, to be held on February 25, 2018. Also on February 22, Gayoung tweeted \"People who play with other people's emotions are the worst!\", to which Hyoeun replied \"True\". Many fans took this to mean that the members were expressing their dissatisfaction with the company. On February 26, it was revealed that Minhee and Hyoeun had chosen not to renew their contracts with the company, and, as a result, the group would be disbanding. Shortly after the disbandment, Minhee gave an interview where she apologized to the group's fans and assured them there was no discord among the members. She stated that Jeonyul and Gayoung were looking to move into acting, but she and Hyoeun had not decided what they were going to do yet. On October 30, 2018 Minhee released a video of Stellar's first reunion party after disbandment through her YouTube channel \"About Mini\". Gayoung, Minhee, Hyoeun and Jeonyul attended the event. Minhee explained that the Reunion Party was created thanks to fans. On October 29, 2018 An SBS Special Documentary was released about the life of idols. A segment on Gayoung and Stellar revealed the difficulties members faced while being a part of Stellar, as well as showing some of the story after the disbandment of the group. The segment focused on Gayoung and her pursuit of being an actress, while running a cafe. In an interview with Insight on December 17, 2018, Gayoung revealed the difficulties that she and her members faced from performing the sexy concept, from both the perception of the public, as well as the pressure that their company placed on members to do what the company wanted, whenever the members said that they didn't want to do a particular thing (such as a particular concept). When asked if she would be an idol again, Gayoung responded that \"I don't think I would do it again\". She concluded the interview with advice to new aspiring idols, that while it is important to work hard, the direction in which you are pursuing is important too. After the Insight interview there was an immense response in the comments left for members both on the Insight interview video, as well as the Stellar reunion party video. In a response to the comments left on Stellar's first reunion party video, Minhee released a Q&A video on January 13, 2019. In response to a question about how much members earned from their work during Stellar, it was revealed that each member earned less than 10,000,000 Won (~$9,000 USD) over the 7 years they worked under their company. On August 28, 2019 it was revealed that Youngheun has become a member of Rania . "}

The group includes seven members from four SM boy groups: Taemin from Shinee , Baekhyun and Kai from Exo , Taeyong and Mark from NCT and Ten and Lucas from WayV . On October 4, 2019, the group debuted with their self-titled EP . All members of SuperM were assembled from existing boy groups under SM Entertainment . Taemin debuted as a member of Shinee in May 2008. Baekhyun and Kai debuted as members of Exo in April 2012. Taeyong , Ten , and Mark debuted as members of NCT in April 2016. Lucas debuted in January 2018 as a new member of NCT. Taeyong and Mark were later added to NCT's South Korea-based sub-unit, NCT 127 , in July 2016, while Ten and Lucas were added to NCT's China-based sub-unit, WayV , in January 2019. In 2019, before the official announcement of SuperM's debut, there had been rumors that SM Entertainment was planning to debut a \" K-pop Super Boy Band\". On August 7, 2019, Capitol Music Group chairman Steve Barnett and SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man officially announced the group as SuperM at Capitol Congress 2019. The \"M\" in SuperM stands for both Matrix and Master, with each member already an established star in their own bands. The teaser revealed the members of the group, with each having performance, vocal, and rap abilities. Lee described the group as \"the Avengers of K-pop,\" with the group focusing more on performance-based music. SM A&R executive and director Chris Lee stated that the group was in the works for around a year, and felt the analogy to the Avengers was apt because according to him, \"Each Avenger has their own group and Iron Man has his own movie and Thor has his own, but together, they have an even greater synergy, so like that the members will pursue their own careers and own groups but also join together with synergy - a positive one.\" Audiences and followers had mixed opinions on the project at first, with some fans enthusiastic for the band's debut following the release of the first teaser at Capitol Congress 2019, while others were concerned about SM Entertainment prioritizing their established groups, Exo members establishing solo careers before their mandatory military service , and the group debuting in the United States rather than starting with Korean promotions. Writing for MTV News , Caitlin Kelley opines that \"the biggest takeaway from the backlash is that it's not that easy to combine the powers of multiple fandoms,\" and felt that the group's structure might be complicated for American audiences, although she noted that \"the fact that SuperM trended worldwide for several hours shows potential. That level of engagement means that there is widespread interest in the group \u2014 now it's just a matter of turning public opinion around.\" Kate Halliwell of The Ringer wrote, \"plenty of people support several groups within the K-pop genre at large, and it makes sense to target them whenever possible...but the toxic side of fandom is difficult to escape.\" She adds that the formation of the group \"once again [proves] how online backlash is inevitable, and often overwhelming, when it comes to navigating multiple K-pop fandoms at once,\" although she felt that the formation of the group \"[signifies] a rising tide in Western K-pop demand.\" SuperM promoted their debut album both in the United States and in South Korea. Several teasers for the group were posted in SuperM's various social media channels. The group filmed their debut music video in Dubai in August 2019. The group's self-titled debut EP was released on October 4, with the instrumental of one of the album's songs, \"I Can't Stand the Rain\", released on August 28. SuperM' s lead single, \"Jopping\", was released alongside its music video on the same day as the EP. The EP debuted at number one at the Billboard 200 albums chart, with 168,000 equivalent album units in the week ending October 10. SuperM had their debut concert at the Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles on October 5, and made their television debut on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on October 9. The group is currently embarking on their first tour, We Are the Future Live, with ten dates in North America from November 2019 to February 2020. The tour was extended to Latin America and Europe, with three tour dates in February 2020. SuperM were announced as global ambassadors for Korean Air in November 2019. On November 4, the group was featured alongside SM labelmate BoA in Korean Air's safety video, which was added to all Korean Air flights on the same day. The song featured in the video, \"Let's Go Everywhere,\" was released on November 18, and proceeds of the song will be donated to Global Poverty Project 's Global Citizen campaign.

As Highlight, the group debuted in 2017 with the mini-album, Can You Feel It? . Beast initially received attention for the lack of industry success previously experienced by its members, with media outlets referring to them as \"a group of recycled material.\" However, the group has achieved significant commercial success and critical accolades and is one of the most awarded groups of all time at the Golden Disk Awards , the Seoul Music Awards , and the Melon Music Awards .

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barberettes", "name": "The Barberettes", "labels": ["EggPlant"], "intro": "The Barberettes ( Korean : \ubc14\ubc84\ub81b\uce20 ) is a South Korean retro , doo-wop female group that debuted in 2014 as a trio, and is based in Seoul . With their covers and original music, they reproduce the sound of the 50s - 60s music, and are referred to as a time slip girl group who travel back to the times of barbershop music and harmonizing girl groups. The group is composed of Shinae An Wheeler ( Korean : \uc548\uc2e0\uc560 ) and Seon (or Sunnie) Lee Kyeong ( Korean : \uc774\uacbd\uc120 ). In 2019 The Barberettes and Sweet Sorrow form a harmony collab group SBSB ( Korean : \uc2a4\ubc14\uc2a4\ubc14 ). The group started singing, as a trio, for fun in October 2012, when Wheeler had the idea of creating a retro-inspired girl group. Wheeler and Grace Kim were already singing solo for the same jazz band , and Park began taking vocal lessons from Wheeler. They performed at a number of places, including the indie music venues in the Hongdae area near Hongik University in Seoul, and for audiences of the older Korean generation, releasing their first album on May 27, 2014. The name \"Barberettes\" was chosen because they wanted to name themselves after the a cappella barbershop music style, hoping to use a name like \"Barbershop Quartet\", but lacking a fourth member, they added the suffix \"ettes\", like many girl groups of the 1950s and 1960s. They often use one microphone for performances, initially to imitate that era's girl groups, but later realizing the advantage when they found they could hear each other better, which helped them control the harmony balance. They also use costumes, make-up and choreography to re-create the effect. They described their music as \"Korean doo-wop done in the 21st century\". They were inspired by doo-wop, Motown , barbershop, and pop music that was created prior to the 1960s, and also by groups like The Andrews Sisters , The Chordettes , and The Ronettes , to whom they have been compared. They gave credit to the 1960s Korean girl group Korean Kittens, and especially The Kim Sisters , whom they discovered on YouTube , as having a large effect on them, and call them their \"biggest idols\". They said they were stunned by the performances of the Kim Sisters, who did not receive a lot of recognition in Korea until recently, but were signed with Motown, and performed on The Ed Sullivan Show many times. Because of the group's performances in indie venues they are often referred to as an indie pop group. Their musical style has been described as \"giving a glimpse into what K-pop might have been like in the 1950s with their styling and song choice\". Shinae An Wheeler, the group's creator, producer, leader, guitarist , main composer and writer was born July 30, 1986 in Seongnam . She graduated from the Seoul Institute of the Arts and started her professional music career at age fifteen as a backing vocalist for some of the S.M.

She teaches at Kwangwoon Conservatory of Music and has taught free music classes and worked with charities for disadvantaged teenagers in Seoul. As one of the group's vocalists, she trades out vocal harmonies with the other two members, sometimes singing lead. Grace (Eun Hye, in Korean) Kim, was born on April 11, 1987 in Seoul. She trained on classical piano , violin and flute , and from 2011-2014 studied at Chung-Ang University . She was active in the indie-jazz scene as a lead vocalist in a 12-piece Korean jazz band called JHG (Just Hip'n Groovy), whose band leader was Jung Jung Hwa, a professor of Seoul Institute of the Arts.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strawberry_Milk", "name": "Crayon Pop", "labels": ["Chrome Entertainment", "Sony Music", "Pony Canyon"], "intro": " Crayon Pop ( Hangul : \ud06c\ub808\uc6a9\ud31d) is a South Korean girl group formed under Chrome Entertainment in 2012. The group consists of four members: Geummi, Ellin, Choa, and Way. Their fifth member, Soyul, left the group in 2017. Crayon Pop officially debuted in July 2012 with their performance of \"Saturday Night\" on Mnet 's M! Countdown . Their first EP was not a commercial success, and when their song \"Dancing Queen\" was released in October, the group had few opportunities to promote on music shows . Instead they held guerrilla performances on the streets of Seoul, which helped increase their fanbase. Crayon Pop gained a huge increase in popularity following the release of their single album \" Bar Bar Bar \" in June 2013. The group's unique stage outfits and choreography gained public attention, and made the title song a viral hit. It eventually managed to reach number 1 on Billboard 's K-Pop Hot 100 . Crayon Pop was able to earn numerous awards, including the New Rising Star Award at the Golden Disk Awards , the Hot Trend Award at the MelOn Music Awards , and Best New Female Artist at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . The group has held solo concerts in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, and has also performed in other countries including Australia and China. Throughout June and July 2014, the group was an opening act Lady Gaga 's ArtRave: The Artpop Ball concert tour. Crayon Pop performed for it in 12 cities around the United States and Canada. Following their appearance in the Artpop tour, the group debuted their first subunit in October. The unit is named Strawberry Milk, and consists of the twin members Choa and Way. In March 2015, Crayon Pop released their second mini album FM , for which they used Super Sentai inspired costumes. They released the song \"RaRiRuRe\" in June of that same year, which was their debut in the Japanese music market. The group continued their Japanese promotions with their second single \"Dancing All Night\" in November. Their first Japanese studio album Crayon Pop was released January 2016, and it ranked #11 on Oricon's Daily Album Charts . Crayon Pop collaborated with Mexican boy band CD9 in August, to release the song \"Get Dumb\". In September, Crayon Pop released the song \"Vroom Vroom\" ahead of their first album Crayon Pop Evolution Pop Vol. 1 . They soon released the music video for \"Doo Doom Chit\", another song that would feature on the track list of the album. On 19 April 2017, the group announced their contracts with Chrome Media had ended in March and they had gone their separate ways, although they would not be officially disbanding. On 30 May, it was revealed that Way, Choa, Geummi and Ellin would continue to promote as Crayon Pop under Chrome Entertainment, but Soyul had chosen to leave the group. The group was initially named Hurricane Pop, and consisted of members Serang (Yang Se-hyeon), Geummi (Baek Bo-ram), Ellin (Kim Min-young), Choa (Heo Min-jin), and Soyul (Park Hye-kyeong). Chrome Entertainment's CEO, Hwang Hyun-chang, did not consider candidates who were taller than 165\u00a0cm or had a sexy image, because he wanted a group of ordinary girls. Soyul was the first member to be accepted, and Geummi was the next to join. Serang, under the name Mari, had formerly been the leader of the disbanded girl group Coin Jackson. Ellin was referred to Chrome Entertainment by Chrome's dance choreographer and was accepted after her third audition. Choa was recommended to the company by Way, her twin sister. Way had been invited to audition, but was unable to do so because she was a member of the indie band N.Dolphin. Singer Bumkey was involved in the audition process and also supervised the group's vocal training. The group recorded their first song 'Bing Bing' as Hurricane Pop. In January 2012, they performed the song live for the first time in Hangzhou , China. The performance of 'Bing Bing' was filmed for the Chinese television drama Curry Campus . A music video for their song was filmed in February, but Serang left the group in May to pursue an acting career. After Serang's departure, Way was given another chance to join the group and she left N.Dolphin. Shortly before their debut the group's name was changed to Crayon Pop, as Chrome Entertainment thought the name Hurricane Pop would be insensitive in light of Japan's tsunamis . The members' stage names were chosen by the company's CEO, although several of them had input into the choice. Crayon Pop began their promotions in Japan in May 2012, using their time there to film music videos for \"Bing Bing\". The group released both the Korean and Japanese music videos in June. The music video for their debut single \"Saturday Night\" was released on 17 July, followed by a Japanese version, as well as an alternate version with new footage, on 24 July. Crayon Pop's first EP , Crayon Pop 1st Mini Album , was released digitally on 18 July and included both \"Bing Bing\" and \"Saturday Night\". The group made their official stage debut the following day on 19 July, performing \"Saturday Night\" on Mnet 's M! Countdown . Crayon Pop's debut did not receive much attention and their album was not commercially successful. Chrome Entertainment's CEO later revealed that the album had depleted all the company's money. Crayon Pop released a digital single album, \"Dancing Queen\", on 24 October 2012. Besides the title track, it also included a remixed version of \"Bing Bing\". In order to stand out from other girl groups, Crayon Pop wore tracksuits instead of more feminine clothing. After seeing a performance of \"Dancing Queen\", Kangin and Shindong of Super Junior praised the song and group, with Shindong saying \"I'd love to produce a girl group like them\". Crayon Pop was only invited to perform on music shows three times, and they were not able to have a typical promotion cycle. As a result, they took to the streets and promoted \"Dancing Queen\" with guerrilla performances, which often took place in extremely cold weather. Chrome Entertainment also produced a reality web series about the group, titled Crayon Pop TV . Through these activities, Crayon Pop developed a loyal fanbase, especially of \"uncle fans\" called \"Pop-jeossi\" (from the Korean word ajeossi ). Crayon Pop returned to Japan and held a mini-concert on 6 January 2013 in Shibuya, Tokyo . Tickets went on sale on 11 December 2012, and sold out in less than an hour. As a result of considerable demand from fans unable to purchase tickets, Chrome Entertainment announced that another Japanese concert would be held at a later date, and a second mini-concert was staged in Osaka on 22 February. On 25 January, Crayon Pop began promoting the remixed version of \"Bing Bing\", which included a popping dance break to Daft Punk 's \" Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger \" instead of the original rap verse. They had a \"delinquent schoolgirl\" concept with new choreography, and wore tracksuits or school uniforms with tracksuit pants. On 19 May, a third Japanese mini-concert was held in Shibuya, Tokyo. A new Japanese member, Arisa, was to be revealed at this concert, but she had withdrawn from the group before the performance. On 8 June, Crayon Pop performed a preview version of their new song \" Bar Bar Bar \". The unusual dance featured choreographed jumping, and they wore scooter helmets, polo shirts, and tracksuit pants with skirts. A story version music video was released on 13 June, a week before the song's digital release on 20 June. Three days later, a dance version music video was released. Filmed with a budget of only 380,000 won (US$347), the music video went viral and Crayon Pop drew interest due to their unique stage outfits and choreography. This music video has more than 51 million views on YouTube as of April 2019. As \"Bar Bar Bar\" went viral, it began to climb the Korean digital music charts, eventually reaching the upper positions of most major real time chart listings. It stayed at the top of Billboard 's Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart for more than a month, and ranked number 1 for the first time eight weeks after release. \"Bar Bar Bar\" solidified its viral status when a parody video was aired on a segment of SNL Korea on 13 August. That same day, it was announced that Crayon Pop had signed a contract with Sony Music Entertainment , who were inspired by the groups' creativity and uniqueness and saw their global market potential. Crayon Pop scored their first music show win when \"Bar Bar Bar\" won first place on Music Bank on 30 August, beating EXO 's \" Growl \". On 9 September, a \"Global Version\" music video was released ahead of Crayon Pop's second mini album, The Streets Go Disco , which was released on 26 September under the Sony Music label. This album consisted of their four previous singles and remixes of those songs. A music video for the title track, \"Dancing Queen 2.0\", was released along with the album. \"Bar Bar Bar\" earned Chrome Entertainment US$2 million in the year after its release, and Crayon Pop was able to move from their small row house in Nonhyeon-dong to a luxury \"villa\" apartment due to their increased income. Crayon Pop's rising popularity also brought them criticism. Netizens accused the group of being affiliated with the right-wing website Ilbe after Way used the phrase nomu nomu (\ub178\ubb34\ub178\ubb34) on Twitter. This phrase was popularized on Ilbe and was used to criticize former president Roh Moo-hyun . It was then discovered that Chrome Entertainment's CEO previously mentioned the website on Twitter. CEO Hwang responded by saying he was registered on many popular online communities, including Ilbe, in order to gather information about singers and girl groups. He also stated that Way's phrase was an example of aegyo and she was not even aware of the website. However, the controversy continued and several of the group's scheduled events were cancelled after criticism from the public.

Crayon Pop's music is often described as electropop and disco-pop dance music with addictive and repetitive lyrics and melodies. Their first single, \"Saturday Night\", was a 1980s -inspired \"electro-pop dance song with a retro melody\". After the release of \"Bar Bar Bar\", Corynn Smith of MTV called Crayon Pop \"a disco-pop K-Pop group that is obviously having a blast\" with \"bafflingly simple lyrics and unexpected choreography.\" Pops in Seoul described \" Lonely Christmas \" as \"a dance song with funk and disco sounds\", while Billboard magazine noted the song's catchy hook and energetic synths, trumpets and guitars. Crayon Pop's sixth single, \"Uh-ee\", is a mix of electronic sounds and trot . Chrome Entertainment called the genre \" house electronic trot\" because it \"is composed of fast beats and strong electronic sounds with addictive trot melody\". Billboard described the song as having a hyper- techno dance beat that would fit into Dance Dance Revolution , while the dance routine was \"more like an intense aerobic workout than a silly dance\". Strawberry Milk ( Korean : \ub538\uae30 \uc6b0\uc720 ; RR : Ttalgiuyu ) is Crayon Pop's first subgroup, featuring twins Choa and Way. Chrome Entertainment announced the subgroup (also called a unit or sub-unit) on 29 September 2014.

On April 5, Red Velvet were featured in a remixed version of \" Close to Me \" by Ellie Goulding and Diplo , with the group contributing Korean lyrics to the song. The song won Choice Electronic/Dance Song at the 2019 Teen Choice Awards . On June 19, Red Velvet released their sixth EP, titled The ReVe Festival: Day 1 , which features the lead single \" Zimzalabim \" and is the first entry of The ReVe Festival trilogy, followed by their seventh EP, The ReVe Festival: Day 2 , with its lead single \" Umpah Umpah \" on August 20. The final release of the trilogy, The ReVe Festival: Finale , was released on December 23, led by the single \" Psycho \". To promote The ReVe Festival trilogy, the group embarked on their third tour, La Rouge, which began in Seoul on November 23 and 24. Red Velvet plays on what they call their \"red\" and \"velvet\" sides, which influences both their image and the music they release. The \"red\" half is their brighter and bubblier side while their \"velvet\" image is their softer, more mature and elegant concept. The 'red' half of the group's music is predominantly of the pop genre while the 'velvet' is primarily R&B and ballads , with the group often mixing it with various genres. Red Velvet's dual image also affects the members' styling . For their \"red\" concept, they are usually dressed in colorful, girlish clothing, such as the pastel sweaters and skirts from \"Ice Cream Cake\" or the red doll outfits from \"Dumb Dumb\". They are dressed more maturely for their \"velvet\" side, most notably, when they wore suits for \"Be Natural\". Red Velvet has been lauded for breaking stereotypes among popular girl groups in South Korea whose concepts tend to fall under two categories which are \"cute or pure\" and \"sexy\", often to fulfill a certain fantasy. In a country where girl groups' fanbases are typically mostly male, according to Taylor Glasby of Dazed Digital , the majority of Red Velvet's fans are young women. IZE Magazine named the group as one of the successful female figures who helped transform the \"passive image\" of South Korean women. Billboard reported in December 2018 that Red Velvet was the overall favorite k-pop group of the year among every gender and sexual identity on the popular internet forum Reddit . In February 2018, Time magazine named Red Velvet as one of the best K-pop groups, highlighting their versatile musical styles. Red Velvet was also recognized for their brand recognition and marketing power, having topped the 'Girl Group Brand Power Ranking' published by the Korean Corporate Reputation Research Institute for three consecutive months. In November 2019, Billboard has crowned Red Velvet as \"the best idol group alive\" and has named \" Red Flavor \" as the second-best K-pop song of the 2010s. Red Velvet performed in Pyongyang on April 1, 2018. This made them the seventh idol group to ever perform in North Korea. They performed \" Red Flavor \" and \"Bad Boy\" at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre to an audience including Kim Jong-un . The concert was billed as \"Spring is Coming\" and is part of a wider diplomatic initiative between South Korea and North Korea. In October of the same year, South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism awarded the group the 'Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism's Commendation' for their contributions in raising awareness of the country's popular culture and arts. The director of the Korea Foundation for International Cultural Exchange while discussing the Korean Wave in 2018 cited Red Velvet as a major contributor and one of the country's most talented idol groups who have \"largely promoted K-pop\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JJCC", "name": "JJCC", "labels": ["Jackie Chan Group Korea", "Teichiku Records (Japan)"], "intro": "JJCC (pronounced J-J-C-C; Hangul : \uc81c\uc774\uc81c\uc774\uc528\uc528) is a six-member South Korean hip hop boy band formed under the management of Jackie Chan Group Korea. The group debuted on March 20, 2014 with five members: E.co, Eddy, SimBa, San-Cheong and Prince Mak who performed live on MNet M Countdown. Their debut single entitled At First was then released on March 24. JJCC is the first K-pop idol group to be formed by Jackie Chan . The name of the band is composed of the man who forms the group and the group's aim. The first \"JC\" comes from the first letters of the words Jackie and Chan while the second \"JC\" comes from the first letters of the words join and cultures . When combined together, it is literally \"Jackie Chan Joint Cultures\" (JJCC) translated to \"Jackie Chan, let's spread K-Pop\". In the same way, the pronunciation of the group name (Double-JC) stands for \"Double Joy Creative\" or \"Let's create double the joy\". The band name is a tribute to Chan as well as his effort to \"join cultures\" in Asia through music. Jackie Chan is a long-time fan of K-Pop. After seeing Kpop's great potential and development, he started to form a Kpop group and even personally manages them. JJCC's aim is for the world to be conquered once Asian culture unites through their different music and charm. In preparation for this, the members of JJCC received individual training on their personality and stunts as well as improving their singing, dancing, rapping, songwriting, and acting skills. Their dance skills include popping, b-boying, and even ballet. They are also able to speak in three languages- English, Chinese, and Korean. Together with Chan, veteran K-Pop producer-composer Choi Jun-Young is serving as the executive producer of the group while Sha-Sha Lee is the CEO of the newly formed Jackie Chan Group South Korea establishment. The group is composed of five Koreans (E.Co, Yul, Zica, SimBa, San-Cheong), one Korean American (Eddy) and one inactive Chinese Australian (Prince Mak). Eddy competed on the cooking challenge show \" Master Chef Korea \" once, and is known for his cooking skills. Members SimBa and Eco are also models. Although K-Pop is still rare on the Western mainstream, the group already attracted the American media prior to their debut mainly because of Jackie Chan . They were included in major news outlets such as the New York Post and even appeared in traditional papers. Jackie Chan's presence gave JJCC a possibility for the Korean wave to enter the American mainstream. On March 13, 2014, JJCC released their first teaser which was posted on their YouTube account, \"Double JC\". During this time, little is still known about the group except the revelation of the members and Jackie Chan as the producer-manager. One week after, on March 20, 2014, JJCC was first seen live on Mnet's M! Countdown , performing \"At First\" (\"Everyone Is Like This At First\"), which was also their official debut date. It was followed by Music Bank and Inkigayo . Finally on March 24, JJCC released their debut single as well as its music video. The song combines a melancholy hip-hop beat and a bit of R&B track. Prince Mak is not included in the music video as it is reported that he injured himself before the filming. Together with Kim Hee Sun and EXO , JJCC are performing on Chan's charity event entitled \"2014 Peace, Love and Friendship\" on April 6 in Beijing. The event, organized by Jaycee Chan , will have celebrities from all over the world and will include a concert, a fan meeting, launching event for \u2018Jackie Chan Film Hall\u2019 in Shanghai and more. The youngest member of the group (Maknae) San-Cheong played a small role in the Korean drama \" Madame Antoine \" which aired in January 2016. Before the group began their Japanese promotions, there was a lot of confusion over Prince Mak's status amongst them. With JJCC's Japanese company and official Facebook page updating JJCC's bio to state that JJCC had six members, many assumed he had left the group. However, Prince Mak personally stated that he is still a member of JJCC, but is currently working on solo activities, although sources such as JJCC's official websites have stated otherwise. Since then Prince has signed to Emperor Entertainment Group Beijing for his acting activities, and JJCC has continued as a sextet. On the SBS PopAsia radio show 'The Prince Mak Hour', Prince Mak answered a fan's question about his status within JJCC. He stated that while he is not signed to JJCC's Korean agency, he still considers himself to be a JJCC member. JJCC will be going on tour in the USA from August 6\u201312. San-Cheong and Yul participated in Produce 101 Season 2 . Both members were eliminated in episode 5.\n"}

The original plan for the two was to debut as the hip-hop duo GDYB, with Kwon choosing the stage name G-Dragon (\"Ji\" is pronounced like \"G\" and Yong is Korean for \"dragon\"). Though they made several appearances both as a duo and as individuals on other artists' music, the plan for their debut was scrapped and they were joined by four other trainees ( T.O.P , Daesung , Seungri and Jang Hyun-seung ) to form Big Bang instead. The formation of the group was documented on television, but prior to their official debut, Jang was dropped. Dong later adopted the stage name Taeyang.

The group's original lineup consisted of leader Ashley and members RiSe , EunB, Sojung , and Zuny. They made their debut with the mini-album Code#01 and the lead track \"Bad Girl\", which were released on March 7, 2013.

Before the establishment of the group, most of the members had some experience in the entertainment industry. Rise participated in Miss Korea 2009 as a representative of Japan, and won the Korean Abroad Award. She gained popularity by starring in the talent show called Star Audition: The Great Birth , and finished in the Top 12. She then appeared with fellow Star Audition contestant David Oh as a couple on the reality show We Got Married in 2011. Rise later signed on with KeyEast before switching agencies in 2013. EunB was previously a trainee under FNC Entertainment, where she was in the original line-up for AOA .

The group's debut mini-album Code#01 along with the title song \"Bad Girl\" and accompanying music video was released on March 7, 2013.

The group's return was originally set for July 25, 2013 however member Zuny had an unexpected leg injury which pushed back their comeback until August. The song debuted high on the real-time charts, achieving their first number-one single on Bugs Music and charting within the top 10 in four other music charts. On August 21, 2013, Ladies' Code announced their comeback for their second mini-album, Code#02 Pretty Pretty , which was released on September 5, 2013. Polaris Entertainment announced on February 4, 2014 that the group would make a comeback with their second digital single \"So Wonderful.\" A still-cut of the first music video teaser was released on February 6, 2014 showing member Kwon Rise lying in transparent plastic wrap.

The group began promotions for the song on KBS's Music Bank the following day. On September 1, 2014, Ashley revealed that the group was in the midst of working on a new album, though whether it was a mini-album or full-length album is unknown. On September 3, 2014 at around 1:30AM ( KST ), the group was involved in a serious car collision while returning to Seoul after attending the recording of KBS \"Open Concert\" at DGIST . The group's manager, Mr. Park, was driving the van and had been speeding, driving 137\u00a0km/h (85\u00a0mph) in a 100\u00a0km/h (62\u00a0mph) zone for a distance of 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi). Rainy conditions made the road slippery, which caused Park to suddenly lose control of the vehicle, causing the group's van to hydroplane and skid several times before crashing into a protective wall in the vicinity of the Singal Junction on Yeongdong Expressway . EunB was declared dead on arrival by the time the paramedics reached Sungbin Medical Center, while the remaining six passengers were rushed to various hospitals. Sojung and RiSe, who suffered the most serious injuries, were taken to the Catholic University of Korea St. Vincent's Hospital in Suwon , listed under critical condition. RiSe's condition quickly deteriorated and she was moved to Ajou University Hospital, where she eventually died four days later on September 7, 2014, at 10:10AM ( KST ). Sojung's condition was stabilized. Ashley, Zuny, Park, and one stylist also sustained minor injuries. On October 29, Ashley and Zuny were released from the hospital and spent time recovering at their respective homes, while Sojung was moved to a hospital in her hometown of Wonju . They returned to their group's dorm in Seoul on November 12, with Sojung continuing to receive outpatient treatment. The investigation conducted by the National Institute of Scientific Investigation (NISI), revealed and confirmed that the cause of the collision was due to driving over the posted speed limit and that the van's back tire came off due to the impact of the van crashing into the protective wall. It had been reported that none of the van's airbags deployed at the time of impact, while witness accounts state that the vehicle rolled over multiple times after it hit the protective wall. An ambulance worker who was at the scene later reported that he did \"not recall undoing any seat belts\" as he attempted to help the injured passengers. In the wake of EunB and RiSe's deaths, the group would go on to achieve major success on the music charts as fans of the group began posting messages on online communities and SNS encouraging people to listen to the song \"I'm Fine Thank You\" (from the group's second EP Pretty Pretty ) as a tribute and to fulfill EunB's dream of ranking first on the music charts. The song would eventually top several real-time music charts including Melon, Bugs, Genie, Monkey3, and Olleh, also peaking at number three on the Gaon Singles Chart , making it their highest charting single. Both \"I'm Fine Thank You\" and \"Kiss Kiss\" would also go on to debut at number six and number 21 on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, marking the group's first two entries on the chart. The group's final performance with all five members aired on KBS on September 14, 2014, bookended with a tribute to EunB and RiSe. On September 15, 2014, Polaris Entertainment released a tribute music video of \"I'm Fine Thank You\", using behind-the-scenes footage of the group to honor EunB and RiSe. On November 12, 2014, Park was arrested and indicted on the charge of causing a fatal collision under the Act on Special Cases Concerning the Settlement of Traffic Accidents and was sentenced to a year and two months in jail on January 15, 2015. On March 25, 2015, Park filed an appeal to reduce his sentence. On April 8, 2015, he reached a settlement agreement with both EunB and RiSe's families for an undisclosed amount. On April 15, 2015, Park's appeal was successful, and his sentence was reduced to a suspended one year and two months jail sentence for a period of two years. He was also required to do 160 hours of community service and attend 40 hours of law-abiding driving classes. On April 26, 2015, it was reported that Zuny, Ashley, and Sojung had resumed their practice schedule while continuing to receive counseling and follow-up treatments for injuries sustained from the crash. Ladies' Code held a memorial concert named \"I'm Fine, Thank You: RiSe & EunB Memorial Concert\" on August 22, 2015, at the Shinagawa Stellar-ball in Tokyo, Japan, in honor of RiSe's dream that Ladies' Code would someday perform in her home country. The concert featured Polaris artists, including Kim Bum-soo and Rumble Fish , and a performance of \"I'll Smile Even If It Hurts\" by Ashley, Sojung, and Zuny. Sojung was involved in the track's composition and production. On September 3, 2015, Sojung and Polaris artists Kim Bum-soo, IVY , Han Hee-jun , Rumble Fish, and Sun Woo released a cover of \"I'm Fine, Thank You\" in memory of EunB and RiSe. A Polaris representative stated that all proceeds from the song would be donated to charity. Ladies' Code members released \"I'll Smile Even If It Hurts\" as digital single on September 7, 2015, the first anniversary of RiSe's death. On January 23, 2016, Ladies' Code was revealed to be preparing for a comeback in the spring, their first comeback since the crash and as a trio. Polaris Entertainment noted the end of February as a tentative comeback date and clarified that there were no future plans to recruit new members. The album named Myst3ry with its title track \"Galaxy\" was released on February 24, 2016. On October 13, 2016, Ladies' Code released their single album Strang3r along with the title track \"The Rain\".

On December 12, 2018, the group released a Christmas single \"The Last Holiday\", making it their first release in two years as a group. In May 2019, Ladies' Code released a single titled \"Feedback\". On October 10, 2019, Ladies' Code released their fourth album Code#03 Set Me Free , their third from the \"Code\" series. This album was released six years after Code#02 Pretty Pretty . The lead single for their fourth album is called \"Set Me Free\", and was written by 1Take and TAK. On February 17, 2020, Ladies' Code left Polaris Entertainment following the expiration of their contracts with the label. The group is currently on indefinite hiatus, with the members pursuing solo careers. Ladies' Code signed their first deal with Pepsi Korea in August 2013 as the company's next models for their 'Open Your Pepsi Now' campaign. In January 2014, the group teamed up with Nexon to promote the winter update for the MMORPG Mabinogi Heroes . Prior to the crash, Ladies' Code's music had been predominantly pop with a retro sound. Billboard magazine noted that the group blends in \"modern electro-pop \" with \"classic throwback elements\" and powerful vocals. The group's debut single \"Bad Girl\" was described as a swing/jazz-inspired track accompanied with solid vocals. Their follow-up single, \" Hate You \" was marked as a departure, returning with a mid-tempo dance song with a combination of brass and acoustic guitar arrangements. Subsequent releases retain their earlier style with Corynn Smith of MTV Iggy explaining their second extended play's title track \"Pretty Pretty\" as another example of the group's \"rich retro sound\", moving from 40s swing to a mixture of 70s and 80s beats. In an interview with enews on their digital single \" So Wonderful \", member Ashley explained the song was a continuation of their previous releases but added that they had incorporated the use of more instruments and were going for a \"retro feeling from the 80's.\" Their first release after the crash, Myst3ry , shifted into an R&B sound with the lead single \"Galaxy\" described as a \"mid-tempo song that invokes a gloomy and dreamlike mood\". Ladies' Code have cited the Brown Eyed Girls and Wonder Girls as their role models, the latter compared to the group by media outlets due to their similar style of music and image. In September 2013, Wonder Girls' member Sunye posted a message on Twitter supporting the group, saying how \"Pretty Pretty\" reminded her on their group's past releases \" Tell Me \" and \" So Hot \".

They released their debut single \"Beatles\" on April 3, 2013. The group originally debuted with a \"boyish\" concept, referring to the fact that the majority of the members had short hair and a more masculine attitude and style, opposed to the feminine concepts many Korean pop girl groups have, but after their line-up changes, the group returned in 2015 with a feminine and sexy concept. The group was announced on March 20, 2013, and image teasers were released revealing the members of the group. It was revealed that they would take on a fresh concept from that of the usual girl group: .mw-parser-output .templatequote{overflow:hidden;margin:1em 0;padding:0 40px}.mw-parser-output .templatequote .templatequotecite{line-height:1.5em;text-align:left;padding-left:1.6em;margin-top:0} Following this, a music video teaser revealed the rappers, OneKet and AI, followed by a video for singers Eunji, Hayun and Aram, and a full group music video teaser. The group released their debut single \"Beatles\" on April 3, 2013 along with its music video. They made their debut on Show Champion the same day. On July 1, 2013, Sim Tong Entertainment released album jacket photos for their upcoming 2nd digital single, \"Because of You\". \"Because of You\" was supposed to be released on the 3rd of July (with the release of Global Icon's first mini album to be later on in August), but the single was delayed to August 30 due to scheduling issues, and the mini album to September 3. The group was also chosen to become models for \"94Street\", a Korean restaurant. This drew some criticism from fans, as the CF features the members dressed in fancy dresses, something which many took to mean that the group was straying from their original \"boyish\" concept. [ citation needed ] The group announced that they would be returning in October of that year with the song \"Don't Lie\", but the song was deemed \"unfit for terrestrial broadcast\" by all the major networks, and they were forced to go with \"Giyeuk\" as their comeback single instead. On June 25, 2014, it was announced by GI International Fanclub that Aram had decided to leave the group. This came after around two months of silence from Aram's social media accounts, right after coming back from promotion in Japan. Representative of SimTong Entertainment initially said to GI International Fanclub that \"Aram's withdrawal from GI and our agency is under discussion\", but then revealed that \"GI will stay as a 5 member group and instead of Aram, a new member will be added in her place.\" It was also announced that GI was preparing for a comeback with the new member, and she would more than likely be taking over Aram's position as main vocalist. Member Hayun uploaded a photo on Twitter on June 19 showing the girls practicing, including a shot of two unknown girls, who fans presumed to be the new members, although they were met with strong criticism when fans noticed that they were lip-syncing during live performances. On November 14, 2014 it was revealed through the group's official page that Hayun had also left the group (in August of that year), leaving the group's future in doubt, although it was announced in January 2015 that the group would be making a comeback in that year. On February 24, 2015, AlphaBat 's Delta made a post on his Instagram account declaring that G.I. would release their third single on February 25. The next day, G.I. member OneKet was revealed to have filed a contract termination lawsuit against Simtong Entertainment citing poor management, and Simtong responded with the claim that OneKet and Aram had breached their contracts. On June 29, SimTong Entertainment dropped individual videos for introducing the three new members: Do Kyung, Ji A-min & Hee So. The group made their comeback with the new lineup on September 2, surprising fans due to their abrupt change from the \"tomboyish\" concept that the group were known and praised for to a far more feminine concept for their 'Doligo Doligo' MV. Neither the music video nor the song were well received, with reviewers saying the imagery of the video was \"risible, inappropriate [and] tasteless\". On March 28, Eunji announced her departure from the group via a tweet that said: \"Everyone who loved and supporting GI, thank you so much, sincerely... I was so happy. I'll come back with a new look. Goodbye for just a little.\" At the same time, Dokyung deleted all her tweets, leading to speculation that the group had disbanded. In May 2016, Heeso redebuted in the girl group AGirls. The group unofficially disbanded soon after, and in August 2016, she joined HEXE for their \"Fallin' Fallin'\" comeback under the stage name \"Jin\". She has since redebuted as the leader of Various as of 2017. [ citation needed ] On April 12, 2017, Dokyung redebuted in the girl group L.U.X. [ citation needed ] "}

It consists of five male members: Yoo Il , Seo Kang-joon , Gong Myung , Kang Tae-oh and Lee Tae-hwan . The group members were selected through Fantagio's \"Actor\u2032s League,\" a program for discovering aspiring actors, and were trained for two years before making their entertainment debut. Unlike idol groups which begin their careers as singers and later expand their endeavors to acting, 5urprise did the opposite. As their first project, they made their acting debut in After School: Lucky or Not , a 12-episode mobile drama with each episode lasting 15 minutes, and viewed through Nate Hoppin, BTV , and T-Store on smartphones and tablet computers . They played five members of a high school club who encounter an outcast (played by actress Kim So-eun ) and as they complete \"missions,\" they build a friendship with each other and coax the shy girl out of her shell. 5urprise released the single \"Hey U Come On\" for the mobile drama's soundtrack . Pre-debut, members of the group also appeared in music videos of female pop group Hello Venus . 5urprise released their first single in 2014, titled From My Heart . "}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2Yoon", "name": "2Yoon", "labels": ["Cube"], "intro": " 2Yoon ( Hangul : \ud22c\uc724, commonly stylized as 2YOON ) was the first and only sub-group of South Korean girl group 4Minute , formed by Cube Entertainment in 2013. The sub-group consisted of Gayoon and Jiyoon . Gayoon and Jiyoon were the lead singers of 4Minute. Cube Entertainment CEO Hong Seung Sung wanted to pair them in a sub-group after watching the duo perform live at the 2011 United Cube in London. The duo were known to fans collectively as Ssangyoon (Hangul: \uc30d\uc724) (a portmanteau of the Hangul word for \"twins\" and the last characters of their given name \"yoon\"). However, as the pronunciation of \"Ssangyoon\" involves a tensed consonant , it was deemed to be ill-fitting for the group's cute image. As such, the sub-unit was renamed as 2Yoon. In addition, \"ssangyoon\" could be potentially misheard as a profanity, further supporting the basis for the name change. 2Yoon appeared on MBC 's Weekly Idol as Ssangyoon, since the show was recorded before the official name change. On January 7, 2013, Cube Entertainment announced that the 2Yoon debut album, Harvest Moon , was slated for a mid-January release, with \" 24/7 \" confirmed as the title track. On January 22, 2013, 2YOON released its album and accompanying music video for \"24/7.\" 2Yoon made its television debut on M! Countdown on January 18, 2013. 2Yoon's members revealed through an interview that they felt motivated and encouraged by Girls' Generation members after a listening session. Gayoon, through another interview, also revealed she lost weight rehearsing to the song's choreography. Due to their innovative efforts, Time Magazine showed interest in 2Yoon's music and observed Korea's potential in the world's music scene. 2Yoon became the first Korean girl group to be interviewed by Time. In the interview with TIME, the members cited that they listened to artists like Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and that they were used as inspiration to the recording sessions. Marc Hogan of Spin called 2Yoon's \"24/7\" music video \"as giddily irresistible as you'd hope\", commending the pair for incorporating elements of country music without losing the \"characteristically hyper-melodic, electronica\"-ness of K-pop. Lily Rothman of Time lauded 2Yoon for attempting the \"unlikely union\" of country music and K-pop, showing the symbiotic influence that both American-music and K-pop exert on each other. Park Hyun-min of Mnet praised the \"light and joyous\" execution of the lead single. \"24/7\" received polarized reviews, some praising its innovative attempt into bringing country music to Korean pop, while others criticized such aspects as its melody, lyrics, rap style and technique, claiming the song as an experimental failure. 2Yoon has been praised by both foreign and domestic music magazines for being the first K-Pop act to release a country-inspired track. 2Yoon became the first sub-unit of a Korean music group to be promoted in Thailand, performing and giving interviews.

They made their debut in 2013 as a five-member group and consisted of Hyangsuk, Hyerin, Dasom, Daeun and Yeonjun. Following Yeonjun's departure, the group continues to promote as a four-member group. 2Eyes was formed by SidusHQ with Hyun Jin-young as their producer. It was SidusHQ's first investment into a K-pop group since the short-lived girl group LUV and the highly successful first-generation boy band g.o.d . Prior to receiving their current name, the group was called \"god5\" (\uac13\ud30c\uc774\ube0c) as they were modeled after the five-member g.o.d. Hyangsuk and Dasom had both competed in the jTBC talent competition Made in U ( ko ) before joining SidusHQ. Hyerin was a former JYP Entertainment trainee. Daeun had been a dancer. Yeonjun, the youngest member, was the final member recruited and had been part of an unsuccessful duo called Spiel (\uc2a4\ud53c\ub12c\ub85c) before joining the KBS singing competition program The Last Audition of My Life ( ko ) where she was scouted by SidusHQ. Prior to their official debut, 2Eyes recorded their version of \"Winter Love\" (\uaca8\uc6b8\uc0ac\ub791), one of the soundtracks of the critically acclaimed SBS drama That Winter, the Wind Blows . It was released in May 2013. The group name was derived from the idea of the members communicating with the audience through their eyes. They then made their debut on June 20, 2013, performing their single \"Don't Mess With Me\" (\uae4c\ubd88\uc9c0\ub9c8) on the Mnet music program M Countdown . The single album and music video for \"Don't Mess With Me\" were released in July. The music video featured fellow SidusHQ artist, actor Kim Woo-bin . Their debut drew much attention from critics as their management agency SidusHQ was better known for managing some of South Korea's top actors and actresses rather than musicians. After Yeonjun's departure, 2Eyes decided to continue promoting as a four-member group. They made their comeback on August 24, 2015 with the single \"PIPPI\", which is based on the children's stories character Pippi Longstocking . The music video featured all for members dressed like Pippi Longstocking before transforming into beautiful young women. In September, their company SidusHQ received a complaint from the Swedish company Saltkr\u00e5kan which owned the copyright to the character Pippi Longstocking over the group's use of the concept without permission. When they debuted, 2Eyes opted for strong feminine and sexy image. Unlike many girl groups who debuted at the time with bubblegum pop and \" cute \" concepts, 2Eyes drew attention for doing the opposite and debuting with a more mature image. "}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BTS_(band)", "name": "BTS", "labels": ["Big Hit", "Pony Canyon", "Def Jam Japan", "[1]", "Columbia", "[2]"], "intro": " BTS ( Korean : \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 ; RR : Bangtan Sonyeondan ), also known as the Bangtan Boys , is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in Seoul in 2010. The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline. The group have staged several world tours. The group initially formed as teenagers under Big Hit Entertainment and released their debut single album, 2 Cool 4 Skool (2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S. Billboard 200 entries The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 (2015), The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever (2016), and Wings (2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group. Wings became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the Korean Wave into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for their single \" Mic Drop \". The band is the first Korean act to top the Billboard 200 with their studio album Love Yourself: Tear (2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums Love Yourself: Answer (2018), Map of the Soul: Persona (2019) and Map of the Soul: 7 (2020), making BTS the fastest group since the Beatles to earn four number one albums in less than two years. Love Yourself: Answer also broke South Korea's Gaon Album Chart 's all-time monthly record previously set by Love Yourself: Tear and became the first Korean album certified Platinum in the United States. Having sold over 20 million albums on the Gaon Music Chart , BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the best-selling album in South Korea with Map of the Soul: 7 . BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the IFPI 's Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won Top Social Artist three years in a row and Top Duo/Group at the 26th Billboard Music Awards . Featured on Time 's international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017\u20132019) and Time 's 100 most influential people in the world (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname \" Princes of Pop \".

BTS are ranked #4 of Billboard 's Top Social Artist of the 2010s, and are the highest group on the list. During their Love Yourself World Tour , BTS became the first Asian and first non-English speaking act to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium ; and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in Rose Bowl Stadium history. Billboard ranked BTS at #45 on their Top Touring Artists of the 2010s list, being the highest-ranked Asian as well as the only non-English speaking act on the list. As of 2019, BTS are purportedly worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, or 0.3 percent of the country's GDP. BTS attracted one in every 13 foreign tourists that visited South Korea and were cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018. Following the establishment of their Love Myself anti-violence campaign in partnership with UNICEF , BTS addressed the United Nations 73rd General Assembly and became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language. The group's name, BTS, stands for the Korean expression Bangtan Sonyeondan ( Korean : \ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8 ; Hanja : \u9632\u5f48 \u5c11\u5e74 \u5718 ), literally meaning \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts\". According to member J-Hope , the name signifies the group's desire \"to block out stereotypes, criticisms, and expectations that aim on adolescents like bullets\". In Japan, they are known as B\u014ddan Sh\u014dnendan ( \u9632\u5f3e\u5c11\u5e74\u56e3 ) , which translates similarly. In July 2017, BTS announced that their name would also stand for \"Beyond the Scene\" as part of their new brand identity. This extended their name to mean \"growing youth BTS who is going beyond the realities they are facing, and going forward.\" BTS began its formation in 2010 after Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk met with group leader RM and was impressed with his rapping. BTS was originally supposed to be a hip-hop group similar to YG Entertainment's 1TYM , but between their initial formation and their debut, Bang Si-hyuk decided that the contemporary youth needed instead \"a hero who can lend them a shoulder to lean on, even without speaking a single word\". The group was meant to debut in 2011 and featured on several tracks by artists such as 2AM and Lee Seung-gi before their debut was postponed and the group was reorganized into a more traditional idol group. The lineup was then finalized with Jin , Suga , J-Hope , RM , Jimin , V , and Jungkook in 2012. Six months prior to their debut, they began to gain attention for their presence on various social media websites, as well as song covers on YouTube and SoundCloud . On June 12, 2013, BTS released their debut single album 2 Cool 4 Skool , the first installment in their \"school trilogy\" series, simultaneously with its lead single \"No More Dream\", which peaked at number 124 in Korea before quickly falling off the charts. While the album peaked at number five in South Korea and eventually sold over 145,000 copies, it was not a major hit, selling only 24,000 copies in 2013. Their subsequent single \u201cWe Are Bulletproof Pt. 2\u201d failed to chart. In 2 Cool 4 Skool , BTS employed an old-school hip-hop sound with scratches from the 1980s-90s and excessively fierce visuals. From their inception, BTS was convinced that telling their story was the only way for the younger generation to relate to their music. The lyrics of the album primarily reflected on the misunderstanding and prejudice towards them, criticism of the society that diminishes their dreams, and their anxiety and determination towards their future. During the production of the album, Suga and RM rewrote the lyrics of \u201cNo More Dream\u201d more than 20 times. The single album's release was followed by several appearances on Korean music shows. Despite being unpolished, these early live performances demonstrated BTS' potential with their intense and charismatic stage presence. Expanding their endeavors to Japan, \"No More Dream\" was later re-recorded in Japanese and released in June 2014. In September 2013, BTS released the second part to their \"school trilogy,\u201d the extended play O!RUL8,2? , along with its single \"N.O,\u201d which peaked at number 92 in Korea. The EP peaked at number four in Korea and has sold over 160,000 copies to date, including 34,000 copies in its release year. Musically, BTS did not fundamentally change their sound as compared with 2 Cool 4 Skool , utilizing fiery rapping along with trap beats, brass, and soulful melodies . Lyrically, the EP expanded on the theme of dreams and happiness, revealing their frustration under the harsh Korean education system and their determination to confront the struggle of proving themselves. Despite several performances on Korean music shows, the single quickly fell off the charts. That same month, BTS starred in their own variety show, SBS MTV 's Rookie King Channel Bangtan , based on a fake broadcast station, \"Channel Bangtan\", through which members parodied variety shows such as VJ Special Forces and MasterChef Korea . At the end of the year, BTS was recognized with several New Artist of the Year awards, including the 5th Melon Music Awards , 28th Golden Disc Awards and the 23rd Seoul Music Awards . The last act to their \"school trilogy\", the EP Skool Luv Affair , was released in January 2014 and topped the Gaon Album Chart , selling 100,000 copies in 2014 and over 250,000 copies overall. It also marked BTS\u2019 first appearance on Billboard 's World Albums Chart, peaking at number three. The album was supported by the singles \"Boy in Luv\" (Korean: \uc0c1\ub0a8\uc790; RR: Sang-namja ) and \"Just One Day\" (Korean: \ud558\ub8e8\ub9cc; RR: Haruman ), which peaked at number 45 and number 149 in Korea, respectively. While Skool Luv Affair musically retained much of their hip-hop influences with the incorporation of R&B and hard rock, the album coincided with a thematic shift from dreams and happiness to love, focusing on school-age and youthful love. Following Skool Luv Affair\u2019s release, BTS made several appearances on Korean music shows and held their first fan meeting that March with an audience of 3,000 fans in Seoul . That July, BTS held their first concert in the United States in West Hollywood for free to an audience of 200 fans. In August, the group also made their first appearance at KCON in Los Angeles . In August 2014, BTS released their first Korean studio album, Dark & Wild , which peaked at number two in Korea and sold over 200,000 copies total. It was supported by two singles: \"Danger\" and \"War of Hormone\" (Korean: \ud638\ub974\ubaac \uc804\uc7c1; RR: Horeumon Jeonjaeng ), which peaked at number 58 and number 173 in Korea, respectively. The album served as a narrative extension of the \u201cschool trilogy\u201d and a transition into their next series. Musically, the album fused the grungy electric guitar sounds of rock within the framework of hip-hop and continued to expand their sound towards R&B . The central theme of the album's lyrics focused on expressing the sentiments of maturing, youthful desires, and impatience for romance. During production of the album, BTS recorded their single \"Danger\" in a makeshift studio in a garage in Los Angeles. Following several appearances on Korean music shows, BTS embarked on their first concert tour , 2014 BTS Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet , from October to December, held in various halls and theaters in six cities: Seoul, Kobe , Tokyo , Manila , Singapore , and Bangkok . Their first Japanese studio album, Wake Up (2014), released that December, peaked at number three on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart and sold 28,000 copies. Along with re-recorded Japanese versions of older songs, it also contained the original tracks \"Wake Up\" and \"The Stars.\" In support of the album, BTS held their 1st Japan Tour 2015 Wake Up: Open Your Eyes in February 2015 to an audience of 25,000 fans in four cities. After ending their Japan tour, BTS held their second solo concert in Korea, BTS Live Trilogy Episode I: BTS Begins, in March to a crowd of 6,500 fans. Shifting their sound and image from solely aggressive, masculine hip hop to more diverse styles, BTS wanted to express the beauty and anxiousness of \"youth\" and settled on the title of \"\u82b1\u6a23\u5e74\u83ef\" (Korean: \ud654\uc591\uc5f0\ud654; RR: Hwayangyeonhwa ), loosely interpreted to define \"youth\" as \"the most beautiful moment in life.\" Their third EP, The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 (March 2015), explored the growth and emotional agony of youth as well as its playful and uplifting sides. Fuse included it as the only Korean album on their list of the \"27 Best Albums of 2015 So Far.\" The EP has sold over 415,000 copies to date. Its lead single \" I Need U \" was BTS' first top five hit in Korea and garnered BTS first ever music show win on SBS MTV 's The Show . While its second single, \"Dope (Korean: \uca54\uc5b4; RR: Jjeoreo )\", only peaked at number 44 in Korea, it peaked at number three on Billboard ' s World Digital Songs Chart and became their first music video to accrue over 100 million views on YouTube in October. The group began the world tour extension of their Red Bullet Tour in June, titled 2015 Live Trilogy Episode II: The Red Bullet , visiting cities throughout Asia, Oceania, North America, and Latin America. Their fourth Japanese single, \"For You\", was released on June 17 to celebrate the first anniversary of their Japanese debut and topped Oricon 's daily chart, selling over 42,000 copies within its first day. BTS later performed at Japan's Summer Sonic Festival on August 15 and 16. In November, BTS commenced their third concert tour, 2015 BTS LIVE \"The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: On Stage\" , debuting their new song and the lead single from their fourth EP The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2 , \"Run\", during the Seoul dates. Thematically, the EP focused more on the serious and speculative aspects of youth, touching on the pursuit of success, loneliness, affection for their origins, and the suffering of the younger generation due to unfavorable conditions in current society. Critically, it was praised as the successful merging of the style of The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1 with BTS' initial identity. The album topped the weekly Gaon Album and Billboard World Albums charts and BTS became the first K-pop act to remain atop the latter for multiple weeks. It also marked their first appearance on the Billboard 200 chart, peaking at number 171 with over 5,000 copies. BTS were awarded Best World Performer at the 17th Mnet Asian Music Awards in recognition of their international fan base. Their first Korean compilation album and the finale to their \"youth series\", The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever , was released in May 2016. It included three new singles: the top 40 hit \"Epilogue: Young Forever\", the top 10 hit \" Fire \" (Korean: \ubd88\ud0c0\uc624\ub974\ub124; RR: Bultaoreune ), and the top 20 hit \" Save Me \". The album topped Gaon Weekly Chart in Korea for two consecutive weeks and peaked at number 107 on the U.S. Billboard 200 . The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever later won BTS' first major Korean award for Album of the Year at the 8th Melon Music Awards . BTS embarked on their Asia tour extension, 2016 BTS LIVE \"The Most Beautiful Moment in Life On Stage: Epilogue\" , from May to August, visiting 10 cities and performing to 144,000 fans. During their tour, BTS held a landmark two-day concert at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul in May, and performed as first time headliners at both U.S. KCON shows held that year in Newark (June) and Los Angeles (July), to sold-out audiences. In line with their other successes, they became the first K-pop group to receive their own Twitter emoji in May 2016. In September 2016, BTS released their second Japanese studio album Youth . It sold over 44,000 copies on its first day of release and peaked at number one in Japan . Pre-orders for their second Korean studio album Wings , released in October 2016, accumulated over 500,000 copies within the first week. Wings combined the themes of youth presented in their previous \"youth series\" with temptation and adversity and, for the first time as a major group effort, included seven solo tracks that demonstrated each members' potential and individuality as independent musicians. The album was generally well-received by critics, with Rolling Stone naming it \"one of the most conceptually and sonically ambitious pop albums of 2016, \" while Fuse praised the \"vulnerable and honest song material\" and diverse tracks. The lead single \"Blood Sweat & Tears\" achieved a music chart \"all-kill\" in South Korea and became their first number one hit on the weekly Gaon Digital Chart. Its music video gained over 6 million views within 24 hours, breaking the previous record held on YouTube for the highest number of views of a K-pop group music video within 24 hours. Wings opened at number 26 on the U.S. Billboard 200, the highest chart ranking ever for a K-pop album, and BTS became the first Korean group to top the Billboard Social 50 chart that month. It was their first \"million seller\" album, moving over 1.5\u00a0million copies in South Korea that year and became the best-selling album in Gaon Album Chart history at the time. BTS were the first artist not from a \"Big Three\" entertainment company ( SM , YG and JYP ) to win Artist of the Year at the 18th Mnet Asian Music Awards in December. In February 2017, BTS released the repackaged edition of Wings (2016) , entitled You Never Walk Alone . Pre-orders of the repackage reached over 700,000 copies, breaking the record for most albums sold in a month. The repackage included an additional four tracks that offered consolation and encouragement to its listeners. Its lead single, \" Spring Day \" (Korean: \ubd04\ub0a0; RR: Bomnal ) met critical praise as \"an intelligent, compelling and elegantly restrained study of loss and longing\" that \"deliberately avoids clich\u00e9 pomp and drama\" by Dazed Digital . Embodying nostalgia and sorrow, it opened a new chapter in BTS' aesthetics and lyricism and attracted fans across generational boundaries. Upon release, \"Spring Day\" topped eight of the major South Korean online music charts, as well as Gaon, and crashed Melon 's digital chart due to the high influx of user traffic. It also entered the U.S. Billboard ' s Bubbling Under Hot 100 singles chart at number 15 with \"zero promotions.\" As evidence of its staying power, \"Spring Day\" is the longest-charting song on Melon by an idol group to date. \"Spring Day\" later won Best Song of the Year at the 9th Melon Music Awards . In conjunction with the release of You Never Walk Alone , BTS commenced their second world tour, 2017 BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour , from February to December. The tour visited 12 countries including Brazil, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, and the United States and gathered 550,000 fans. On the tour, BTS began to play progressively larger venues, moving from halls into arenas and domes. Tickets for the North American leg sold out within minutes and two additional shows were added due to high demand, making BTS the first K-pop act to sell out arenas in the United States. After completing their North American leg, BTS attended the 24th Billboard Music Awards in May and won Top Social Artist , becoming the first Korean group awarded a Billboard Music Award. Celebrating Korean music icon Seo Taiji 's 25th anniversary as a part of his anniversary project \"Time: Traveler\", BTS released a remake of Seo Taiji's 1995 classic \" Come Back Home \" in July 2017, reworking the sound and lyrics to similar sentiments toward societal change that Seo Taiji argued for in his songs. BTS was later invited by Seo Taiji to perform as backup vocalists and dancers for eight songs in his Seoul Olympic Stadium concert held early September. During the concert, Seo Taiji acknowledged BTS' thematic similarities to his music and recognized the group as his musical successors, declaring, \"This is your generation now. Show them.\" Following the depiction of growth and temptation in Wings (2016) and consolation in You Never Walk Alone (2017), BTS embarked on their \"Love Yourself\" series which sought the enlightenment of self-love through the \" \u8d77\u627f\u8f49\u7d50 \" (Korean: \uae30\uc2b9\uc804\uacb0; RR: G iseungjeongyeol ) narrative sequence of \"beginning, development, turn, and conclusion.\" In September 2017, BTS released the first part of the series, their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her and featured music from the Chainsmokers ' Andrew Taggart for the track \"Best of Me\". The EP was supported by two singles: the lead single \" DNA \" and a Steve Aoki remix of their song \" Mic Drop \" featuring American rapper Desiigner . In the narrative sequence, the EP represented the \"\u627f,\" or \"development\" of the series and is considered by RM to be one of the major turning points in BTS' career. Within the larger narrative, Love Yourself: Her described the joy and happiness of falling in love. Sonically, the EP served as \"a dual exploration of the group's electro-pop and hip-hop leanings,\" with the first half consisting of \u201cdance tracks that emphasize the group's vocals\" while in the second half \"the act's hip-hop side arrives in earnest...delivering powerful rap performances.\" Commercially, BTS continued to hit new career heights with the Love Yourself: Her EP, debuting at number seven on the Billboard 200 with 31,000 album-equivalent units. In Korea, the EP sold over 1.2\u00a0million copies on the Gaon Album Chart in its first month, achieving the highest monthly album sales in the chart's history and the highest on any Korean chart in 16 years, second to g.o.d 's Chapter 4 album in 2001. The single \"DNA\" was released simultaneously with the EP and debuted at number two in Korea. Its music video broke the previous record for most viewed K-pop group music video within the first 24 hours with more than 20 million views on YouTube . \"DNA\" also became the group's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 85, making BTS the first K-pop boy band to do so and the second Korean act with a Korean-language song. The following week, \"DNA\" rose to number 67 and became the highest-charting song on the Billboard Hot 100 for a K-pop group, beating Wonder Girls ' previous record at number 76. The following single \" Mic Drop (Remix) \" peaked at number 28 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first top 40 entry for a K-pop group on the chart. Both \"Mic Drop Remix\" and \"DNA\" were later certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) making BTS the first and only Korean artist to receive two certifications. \"Mic Drop\" went on to receive Platinum certification in November 2018, making BTS the first Korean group with a Platinum-certified single in the United States. In December 2017, \"DNA\" and \"Mic Drop\" were released as a triple-A side single in Japan with the new song \"Crystal Snow\", which topped the Oricon Chart and became the highest-selling single from a K-pop artist within a week. The single sold more than 380,000 copies by the end of the year and BTS became the only foreign artist to have a single certified double platinum by the RIAJ that year. In November 2017, BTS became the first K-pop group to perform at the American Music Awards , raising their profile internationally. That same month, Guinness World Records revealed that BTS had earned a spot in their 2018 edition for \"having the world's most Twitter engagements for a music group\". In December, they also became the first K-pop group to perform on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to welcome the new year and made their Japanese TV music show debut on TV Asahi ' s Japan Music Station Super Live . At the end of the year, BTS won their second Artist of the Year at the 19th Mnet Asian Music Awards , becoming the first act to win the award two years in a row. They also became the first artist outside of the \"Big Three\" to win major awards at the Golden Disc Awards and the Seoul Music Awards , respectively. In the lead up to their next album, BTS released an original eight-episode documentary series exclusively on YouTube Premium entitled Burn the Stage that ran from March until May 2018, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the group's 2017 Wings Tour. In April, the group also released their third Japanese studio album, Face Yourself , which debuted at number 43 on the Billboard 200 as the third-highest-charting Japanese album in the history of the chart. In conjunction with the release of Face Yourself , the group released a nine-minute short film titled \"Euphoria: Theme of Love Yourself: Wonder ,\" which featured the song \"Euphoria\" and embodied the \"\u8d77\" or \"beginning\" of the narrative sequence. In May 2018, BTS released their third Korean-language studio album, Love Yourself: Tear in conjunction with an appearance at the 25th Billboard Music Awards . At the show, BTS debuted as performers with the premiere of their lead single, \" Fake Love \" and won Top Social Artist , making them the only Korean artist to win the award two years in a row. In the narrative sequence, the album coincided with the \"\u8f49\" or \"turn\" of the series, touching on the tortuous enlightenment of loving without being loved and encouragement to those without dreams. It received generally positive reviews from critics. Caitlin Kelley from Billboard described the album as \"one of their most thematically cohesive yet sonically varied albums, with maximalist production erupting against lyrics about emptiness,\" while Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork wrote that the album \"formula is a slick, loosely thematic album about love and loss, with a stronger focus on rapping than ever before\" and that it \"aims for cohesion and produces fun, prismatic songs in the process.\" Commercially, Love Yourself: Tear was one of BTS' most successful albums, bringing them to new heights both domestically and internationally. The album debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 with 135,000 album-equivalent units (including 100,000 pure album sales), becoming BTS' highest-charting and first number one album in the US, the first K-pop album to top the U.S. albums chart, and the highest-charting album by an Asian act.

In South Korea, Love Yourself: Tear sold over 1.6 million copies in its first two weeks, making it the highest monthly sales for an album since the Gaon Chart's inception at that time. As the conclusion of the Love Yourself series, BTS released their second Korean compilation album Love Yourself: Answer in August 2018, which contained songs from the previous Love Yourself releases along with seven additional new tracks. The album was supported by the lead single \" Idol \" and the alternative digital release featuring Nicki Minaj . Thematically, Love Yourself: Answer placed the songs of the Love Yourself series within the narrative of beginning, development, turn and conclusion to illustrate the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of self-love. Critically, the album received generally positive reviews, with Billboard calling it a \"masterful culmination of years of work and rife with meaning\" and \"undeniably a magnum opus from BTS that that few other artists, boy bands or otherwise, ever can hope to achieve.\" Commercially, the record sold over 1.9 million copies on the Gaon Album Chart in August 2018, breaking the chart's all-time monthly record once again. The album became BTS' second number-one album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and their highest sales week in the country at that time, making BTS the only K-pop act with two Billboard 200 toppers and the first pop act with two number one albums in less than a year since One Direction topped the chart with Midnight Memories in 2013 and Four in 2014. Love Yourself: Answer later became the first Korean language album to be certified Gold by the RIAA in November. In Canada, Love Yourself: Answer became the band's first number-one album on the Canadian Albums Chart . In the United States, \"Idol\" peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 .

In conjunction with Love Yourself: Answer ' s release in August 2018, BTS commenced their third world tour, BTS World Tour: Love Yourself , with a landmark concert in the Seoul Olympic Stadium , the largest stadium in South Korea. During their tour, BTS also featured on Steve Aoki 's single \" Waste It On Me \" released that October, which was their first and only all-English language feature. On tour, BTS continued to play to progressively larger venues from arenas to domes to stadiums. For the final stop of the North American leg, the band performed at Citi Field in Queens , marking the first time a Korean act has performed at a U.S. stadium. All 40,000 tickets for the stadium date sold out in under 20 minutes. According to StubHub BTS was one of 2018's best-selling concerts in international markets outside the US, second to only Ed Sheeran . Vivid Seats named BTS the 2018 artist of the year, citing the group's history-making concert at Citi Field. The tour also received generally positive reviews from critics. Philip Cosores from Uproxx described BTS' four nights at the Staples Center as an \"enormous, multi-sensory experience\" bringing an \"inclusive\" and \"multicultural experience\" where music is above any language barrier, while Crystal Bell from MTV said \"BTS have created an experience so captivating, so inclusive, and so visually stunning that it\u2019s cemented the boy band as one of the most vital acts in pop music today.\" That October, with more than a year remaining in their contract, BTS renewed their contract with Big Hit Entertainment through 2026. In early November 2018, a popular Japanese music show cancelled BTS' performance citing a T-shirt a member wore the year before. In the same month the Jewish human rights organization Simon Wiesenthal Center (SWC) stated BTS owed victims an apology for the shirt in 2017, clothing with Nazi symbolism, and a flag. Big Hit Entertainment issued an apology, saying that the images on the clothing were not intended to be hurtful to the victims of Nazism or atomic bombings, and that the band and management would take steps to prevent future mistakes. They also stated the flags were meant to be a commentary on the Korean school system. The apology was accepted by SWC and the Korean Atomic Bomb Victim Association. Crossing over to film, BTS released Burn the Stage: The Movie in theaters worldwide in November 2018 to commercial success. In the United States it accumulated $1.2 million on opening day for a total of $3.54 million over the three day weekend, breaking the record for the highest grossing event cinema musical production which was previously set in 2014 by the band One Direction. It ranked at number ten in the box office despite selling at only 620 locations compared to the 2,000-4,000 locations for the other top ten sellers. At the end of the year, BTS won their third Artist of the Year at the 20th Mnet Asian Music Awards in a row and ranked number eight on Billboard's year-end Top Artist Chart alongside the likes of Drake and Taylor Swift and were also the number two act of the year in the Duo/Group ranking, only behind Imagine Dragons . They also made the Bloomberg 50 due to their \"willingness to address social issues, mental health, and politics, despite being in a genre often painted as bubble gum pop\". The group sold more than ten millions albums in South Korea alone, with five million being sold in 2018 alone. In February 2019, BTS attended the 61st Grammy Awards as award presenters.

Doty 's memoir Into the Magic Shop . Their 2019 album Map of the Soul: Persona gains its name from Murray Stein's Jung's Map of the Soul: An Introduction . BTS co-writes, produces, and composes much of their output. Since their inception, BTS have developed and maintained a style of \"fusion music\" with an emphasis on hip hop as their musical base largely due to the influence of RM and Suga's background as underground rappers and their main producer Pdogg. Rather than wanting to stick to a specific genre, BTS have introduced brand new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album. BTS' sound began with old-school hip hop influences heard on 2 Cool 4 Skool and O!RUL8,2? , but evolved to include R&B and rock with Skool Luv Affair and Dark and Wild , orchestral strings and electronic dance music with their The Most Beautiful Moment in Life album series, moombahton , neo soul , and gospel in Wings and You Never Walk Alone , future bass , Latin pop , and jazz hip hop in their Love Yourself album series and emo rap , rap-rock , Afro pop , nu-disco , funk , trap and pop-rap in their Map of the Soul album series. BTS' lyrics include social commentary , often incorporating criticism of South Korean society. Songs such as \" No More Dream \" and \" N.O \" from their \"school trilogy\" were motivated by their experiences with South Korea's emphasis on education and called for change to the education system and societal expectations. Their experiences with youth culture in South Korea inspired songs like \" Dope \" and \" Silver Spoon \" (Korean: \ubc41\uc0c8; RR: Baepsae ) from their \"youth series,\" referencing generational disparity and the millennial 's giving up of romantic relationships, marriage, children, proper employment, homes, and social life in the face of economic difficulties and societal ills while facing condemnation from the media and older generations. The song \" Am I Wrong \" from Wings (2016) questioned societal apathy towards the state of current events\u2014the lyric \"We're all dogs and pigs / we become dogs because we're angry\" referenced the South Korean Ministry of Education official Na Hyang-wook who was a proponent of the caste system and described the average person as \"dogs and pigs,\" and BTS performed the song on television during the 2016 South Korean political scandal that led to the impeachment of ex-President Park Geun-hye . RM and Suga's personal struggles with mental health inspired songs like \" Tomorrow \", \" Intro: The Most Beautiful Moment in Life \", \"So Far Away\", \"The Last\", and \" Forever Rain .\" \" Not Today \" from You Never Walk Alone (2017) is an anti-establishment anthem, with messages advocating for minority groups, while \" Spring Day \" was created to memorialize the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy . BTS' albums have recurring themes that fall under the overarching theme of \"reflection of youth.\" Their \"school trilogy\" explored \"the troubles and anxieties of school-age youth.\" Their \"youth series\" \"tackled a subject that the vast majority of youth experience, but few pop musicians articulate well: mental health and the desire to belong in society.\" Wings (2016) focused on temptation and sin. The \"Love Yourself\" series utilized a narrative form to illustrate the excitement of love, the pains of farewell, and the enlightenment of self-love. Since their inception, BTS have held the belief that telling their story is the only way for the younger generation to relate to their music. Writing over 90 percent of their lyrics, BTS try to include experiences everyone has felt in life, such as sadness and loneliness, and turn them to something more light and manageable. In regards to their lyricism, RM states he tries to not sound as if they're preaching or reprimanding people in their songs as everyone has different lives and different destinies. When asked if it is difficult to write about things like mental health, Suga responded, BTS has been praised for \"speak[ing] honestly about topics they deem important, even in a conservative society\" by Jeff Benjamin in Fuse magazine . South Korean president Moon Jae-in , in a letter to BTS, recognized their sincerity and inclusion of diversity as key to their success, writing, \"Each of the seven members sings in a way that is true to himself and the life he wants to live. Their melody and lyrics transcend regional borders, language, culture, and institutions.\" BTS have been described as \"easily the biggest and most successful name in K-pop in the world\" that can \"do things no other name in their genre can\", with Time giving them the nickname \"Princes of Pop\". Billboard Senior Vice President Silvio Pietroluongo said that BTS are comparable and as influential to the Beatles and The Monkees . Nielsen Music Vice President Helena Kosinski says that \"although BTS weren't the first to open the doors to K-Pop worldwide, they were the first to become mainstream. They don't just appeal to young people but also to the 50s and 60s age demographic.\" As the first non-English speaking artist to make the Global Artist Chart in 2018, BTS had the second and third best-selling albums worldwide and were the second best-selling artists worldwide in terms of physical, digital, and streaming platforms, coming second only to Drake . In 2019, BTS were again named as one of the top 10 Global Recording Artists of the year by IFPI , for a second time, ranking #7. They were the only non-English speaking act on that list.

In 2019, BTS ranked 43rd on Forbes ' annual list of the 100 highest-paid celebrities with earnings of $57 million.

Other notable people included in this list were Malala Yousafzai and Bill Gates . In California , BTS inspired a teacher to have his school be the first in the country to offer a Korean American Culture and Society course. Kang Soojung, exhibition manager at the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art, said that while preparing the 50th anniversary exhibition called \u201cSquare,\u201d she was greatly influenced by BTS's hidden track \u201cSea\". The group's influence has led them to address the United Nations at their 73rd General Assembly and to perform before 400 officials including South Korean president Moon Jae-in at the 2018 Korea-France Friendship Concert in Paris , a summit meant to show the friendly relations between France and South Korea. Moon Hee-sang , Speaker of the National Assembly, said that \"BTS is doing most of our work,\u201d attributing the results of his overseas trip to the credit of the global group on an overseas trip to promote \u201csales diplomacy\". In September 2019, president Moon Jae-in also mentioned BTS in his announcement for his '3 major innovation strategies for the contents industry', stating that BTS has pioneered innovative business models that communicate directly with fans. In October 2019, The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism selected BTS as a recipient for a 'Letter of Appreciation', for showing the world the beauty of Korean traditional culture (Hangul, Hanbok, Gugak) through creative re-interpretations in their music. In December 2019, according to the annual survey conducted by Gallup Korea, BTS were the most preferred artists of 2019 for a second consecutive year. According to the \"2019 South Korean National Image\" survey conducted by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and its affiliate the Korean Culture and Information Service among 16 countries, BTS were chosen #2 with 5.5% votes. Despite cultural medals traditionally being given to recipients with more than 15 years of notable achievements, BTS became the youngest ever recipients honored with the Order of Cultural Merit by the President of South Korea in 2018 after five years after debuting, due to their noteworthy contributions in spreading Korean culture and language. BTS have measurably revitalized the Korean economy and the global music industry. Credited for the surge in popularity of online purchases of K-pop items and the growth of the Korean Wave between 2016 and 2018 by the Korea Customs Service and Korea Foundation , BTS were cited as one of the main driving forces for the recovery of South Korea's music-related sector to levels seen before China's 2016 ban on domestic cultural contents over soured diplomatic relations. Yung Duk Kim, vice president and chief operating officer of the Korea Creative Content Agency , stated K-pop has \u201cskyrocketed\u201d since BTS' popularity surged, creating jobs not only for BTS and their team but other K-pop idols as well. Various news outlets coined the term the \"BTS effect\" to refer to the commercial effects of BTS' influence, such as when KB Kookmin Bank savings accounts increased six-fold compared to the prior year following BTS' endorsement and when stock prices of entertainment companies in South Korea shot up for five days after BTS topped the U.S. Billboard 200 . The effect was also observed when companies tied to BTS, such as Netmarble , NetMark, Soribada , Key Shares, GMP, Diffie, and Mattel had their stocks rise. In October 2019, Mattel 's international gross sales rose 10% to $721.7 million, lifted by sales of dolls based on BTS.

In December 2018, the Hyundai Research Institute estimated that BTS were worth more than $3.67 billion to the Korean economy each year, attracting one in every thirteen foreigners who visited Korea. BTS' two day fan-meetings held in Seoul and Busan in June 2019 generated a total economic effect of \u20a9481 billion ($408 million) to both cities, accounting for 1.6% of Busan's 2018 GDP , and 0.9% of Seoul's 2018 GDP.

VIXX presented a musical-like stage as coming off from the-usual-concert which displays singing and dancing. VIXX led their fans to UTOPIA that they constructed\".

Most, if not all of their songs, play on the depth of raw human emotion. VIXX plays an active role producing their music, with all members participating in the ideas and concepts.

It was announced shortly afterwards that members Hani and Solji would form a subunit called \"Dasoni\". The sub-unit released their debut single \"Goodbye\" on February 15, with the B-side track \"Said So Often\". In June 2014, EXID was announced to have signed an exclusive contract with Yedang Entertainment, and were preparing a comeback in collaboration with producer Shinsadong Tiger. On August 24, 2014, EXID held their comeback showcase at the Ilchi Art Hall, performing their new song \" Up & Down \". The song was released on August 27, 2014 and initially charted poorly, failing to make it onto the top 100 of the Gaon Chart ; though it peaked at number 94 on the domestic chart. However, the song slowly gained popularity in early October 2014 after a fan-recorded video of Hani performing the song went viral on South Korean social networking websites. This led to the song shooting back up record charts, eventually climbing into the top 10 on the real-time charts and topping the Gaon Chart. Because of the success of the fancam, EXID was invited back onto stage to promote despite the fact their promotions ended months prior. Due to this success, EXID returned to several music programs to promote \"Up and Down\". The song was subsequently nominated for a first place award on Show! Music Core , Inkigayo , and M Countdown , where they took their first music show win since debut. The group won a second award at Music Bank on January 9, 2015, and a third one at Inkigayo on January 11, 2015. On April 13, 2015, the music video for the title song \"Ah Yeah\", from EXID's second EP, was released.

On January 11, 2016, EXID signed with China's entertainment company Banana Project in a bid to extend its popularity outside Korea. This sparked discussions regarding EXID's future activities in South Korea; however, CEO of Banana Culture Music Wang Sicong assured fans that the next album his company invested on EXID would be released simultaneously in China and South Korea. On March 2, EXID's record label Yedang Entertainment changes name to Banana Culture, launching a joint venture company in Seoul with Banana Project. On March 18, EXID held their first Chinese fan meeting, 'EXID's LEGGO Show in Shanghai'. On June 1, the group released their first studio album titled Street with the title track \"L.I.E\". Street includes 12 tracks, many of which were written and/or composed by LE. EXID's first studio album also included \"Hello\", a solo song by lead vocalist Hani and \"3%\", a solo song sung by main vocalist Solji. The album peaked at number two in Korea on the Gaon Album Chart, while \"L.I.E\" peaked at number five as a single. On June 8, 2016, EXID won first place with \"L.I.E\" on Show Champion and soon after, they won first place on both Inkigayo and The Show as well. On December 20, 2016, EXID released their first Chinese single, \"Cream\" on QQ Music and YinYueTai -which peaked at number six on the Billboard China V Chart. However, a day later, Banana Culture announced that Solji had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism , and that she would halt all her activities for the awards season of 2016-17, while the remaining four members continue on. On January 10, 2017, the group released their second Chinese single \"Up & Down\" ( Chinese : \u4e0a\u4e0b ; pinyin : Sh\u00e0ngxi\u00e0 ). On the same day of its release, an edited version music video for \"Up & Down (Chinese Ver.)\" was uploaded to YouTube and the original was removed. Some Chinese fans found EXID's dancing in the ' Forbidden City ' to be inappropriate whilst some thought that it was completely normal. On March 17, the four members of EXID excluding Solji performed at the Mexico City Arena as part of the KCON music festival in Mexico, with Hani covering Mexican duo Jesse & Joy 's \"Ecos De Amor\". Due to Solji's remaining health issues, the group's comeback was delayed until April. Their agency announced in March that EXID would return as a four-piece while Solji recovered from her hyperthyroidism. On April 10, EXID officially released their third EP Eclipse and their title song \"Night Rather Than Day\". Eclipse debuted at number four on the Billboard World Albums chart , becoming the group's best-charting \u2013 and first top-five \u2013 album on the chart to date. On April 25, 2017, EXID won first place on The Show with \"Night Rather Than Day\". This was followed by their second win with this song on Show Champion the following day and their third win on The Show on May 2, 2017. On May 12, Banana Culture Entertainment has announced that EXID would embark on a promotional Asian tour during the summer. Titled \u2018EXID Asia Tour 2017\u2019, the group visited a handful of countries for the tour, starting in Hong Kong and Singapore. They originally planned to visited Taiwan on July 30, before performing a homecoming concert in Seoul on August 12; however, due to safety concerns over the threat of Typhoon Nesat , the Taiwanese show was postponed to August 26. Solji gave a surprise appearance at the encore of the Seoul concert before resuming her treatment; neither the audience nor the rest of the group knew of her visit. The Asian tour wrapped with their Taipei concert on August 26. EXID's fourth mini album Full Moon was released on November 7, 2017. This marks the return of member Solji, who was absent from the group since 2016. This time, Solji only participated in the recording process but was absent from the promotions and the title track's music video. On November 21, 2017, EXID won first place on The Show with \"DDD\". From December 2017 onwards, EXID, through their social media platforms, shared photo teasers for a project named re:flower , whose songs would be remasters and remakes of past their songs that weren't title songs. EXID returned with a single album Lady on April 2, 2018, only promoting as four, however, due to Solji still recovering from surgery. The lead track for the album is entitled \"\ub0b4\uc77c\ud574 (Lady)\". On April 10, 2018, EXID won first place on The Show with \"Lady\". On 11 May, Banana Culture announced EXID's launching of their Japanese official website, which included a Japanese fan club. They also announced a debut showcase at Tokyo to be held on June 27. During the showcase, EXID announced their release of the Japanese version of \"Up & Down\" on August 22, as well as their first Japanese tour to be held between August 23 and 25, with Solji confirming that she will have returned by then.

On September 6, Banana Culture released a statement, announcing that Solji will join EXID on September 7 to attend the 2018 Hallyu Pop Festival in Singapore as her first official schedule. This marked the formal return of Solji into EXID, of which she will be joining in all of their future group promotions. Solji appeared with the rest of the group members on stage on August 10, on day 2 of HallyuPopFest 2018 , in which she performed 5 of their title tracks with the group. Solji continued to successfully defend herself over all contestants in the next 8 episodes since her initial victory in King of Mask Singer , before ending her streak as the winner of 82th to 86th generation on October 21. After her defeat, she revealed her identity, and explained her choice of return through the show as it was where she rose to fame. To further their promotions since their debut in Japan, the music video for the Japanese version of \"Up & Down\" was released early on August 10 before the launch of the Japanese debut album, which debuted at number 15 on the Daily chart of Oricon. On November 11, EXID made a full-member comeback with the single album I Love You , while releasing the music video with the same title. \"I Love You\" entered Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart at number 5, which was by far their highest achievement in the chart.

In February 2019, EXID held their second Japanese live tour, titled \"2019 EXID Valentine Japan Live Tour\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EvoL", "name": "EvoL", "labels": ["Stardom Entertainment"], "intro": " EvoL ( Korean : \uc774\ube14 ) was a five-member South Korean girl group under the label Stardom Entertainment . They released their debut EP and music video for the track \"We Are a Bit Different (\uc6b0\ub9b0 \uc880 \ub2ec\ub77c; Urin Jom Dalla )\" on August 10, 2012. In August 2015, the group unofficially disbanded, following Yull, Hayana and J-Da's departures. In March 2012, Cho PD announced the upcoming girl group. Although initially intended to debut in April through a variety show, their debut date was changed to August 2012. The group garnered much interest prior to their debut from both domestic and international fans. The group went through member changes before the final line-up was released. Current members Say and J-Da made an appearance in labelmate Block B 's music video \"NanlinA\", alongside two other former members of the group, Song Kwanghee and Lee Dasom, the latter who was formerly a member of the girl group Tahiti. Jucy was also an underground rapper known as \"Juni.J\", and had released a few tracks of her own, having penned her own lyrics.\nOn July 12, 2012, EvoL's first audio teaser was released, followed by a series of both video and audio teasers that showcased a sample of songs from their EP. On August 10, 2012 the group released their EP \"\ud3ed\ud30c\ud574\uc918! (Let Me Explode!)\" and an MV for the single \"\uc6b0\ub9b0 \uc880 \ub2ec\ub77c (We Are A Bit Different)\". The album consists of five tracks and is available on CD and also for digital download.\nOn August 16, 2012, EvoL made their stage debut with their single \"\uc6b0\ub9b0 \uc880 \ub2ec\ub77c (We Are A Bit Different)\" on M!Countdown. On December 13, 2012, Say tweeted a photo of herself and the other members, with the caption: \"It's New EVOL! \ubcf4\uace0\uc2f6\uc5b4 \ub9ce\uc774\ub9ce\uc774 Guyz how do u do~we miss u so so much..Thanks 4 waiting us. We'll meet u r expectation soon\". On March 6, 2013, EvoL announced their official comeback set for March 18, releasing teaser images of Say and Hayana, while J-DA, Yull and Jucy's teasers were released two days later. EvoL then released several tracks from their 2nd mini-album \u2018Second Evolution\u2019 on March 18 at noon, with the digital album release on March 19. The offline release of the album was set for March 20. EvoL showed their \u201ccrab dance\u201d choreography in the music video for their title track \u201cGet Up\u201c and released a short 30-second clip teaser of member J-DA riding a mechanical bull. In the summer of 2013, Jucy released a mixtape, and in May 2015, she joined the cast of Show Me The Money (seasons 2 and 4), only to be eliminated very early on in the competition. During the summer of 2015 rumors appeared on fansites alleging that Say's contract with Stardom had expired and that she had left EvoL (while still remaining with Stardom Entertainment), and would redebut as a solo artist. Fans also alleged favouritism from Cho PD on Say's behalf, claiming that they had given her special treatment (giving her time off, allowing her to skip group performances, etc.). Cho PD and Stardom Entertainment have never responded officially to these claims. In August 2015, it was revealed that Yull, Hayana and J-Da had had their contracts terminated without their knowledge during Stardom's merge with Hunus Entertainment, thus effectively disbanding the group. In the fall of 2015 Say began a solo project under the name \"$aay Choreography\" and redebuted as a solo artist in 2017 under the stage name SAAY, releasing her first full album in May 2018. Hayana also redebuted as a solo artist in 2017, and has released three singles. In October 2016, J-Da joined the group Oh!Bliss, using her real name YeonJoo. "}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exo_(band)", "name": "Exo (band)", "labels": ["SM", "Avex"], "intro": " Exo ( Korean : \uc5d1\uc18c ; stylized in all caps ) is a South Korean\u2013Chinese boy band based in Seoul , with nine members: Xiumin , Suho , Lay , Baekhyun , Chen , Chanyeol , D.O. , Kai and Sehun . The band was formed by SM Entertainment in 2011 and debuted in 2012. Their music incorporates genres like pop , hip-hop , and R&B , alongside electronic dance music genres like house , trap , and synth-pop . Exo releases and performs music in Korean , Mandarin , and Japanese . The band ranked as one of the top five most influential celebrities on the Forbes Korea Power Celebrity list each year from 2014 to 2018, and have been named \"the biggest boy band in the world\" and the \" kings of K-pop \" by media outlets. Since 2014, Exo has exclusively performed as one group, while continuing to release and perform music in multiple languages. Previously, the band debuted with twelve members separated into two sub-groups: Exo-K (Suho, Baekhyun, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, and Sehun) and Exo-M (Xiumin, Lay, Chen, and former members Kris , Luhan , and Tao ). Exo-K and Exo-M performed music in Korean and Mandarin, respectively, until the release of their third EP Overdose in 2014. After the departures of Kris, Luhan, and Tao amid legal battles in 2014 and 2015, the band continued with the remaining nine members. Since 2016, Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin have also released music and performed as a sub-unit named Exo-CBX , and members Sehun and Chanyeol have promoted as a sub-unit named Exo-SC since 2019. All of Exo's members also maintain solo careers in fields including music, film, and television. Exo's first album XOXO (2013), which contains the breakthrough hit \" Growl \", was a critical and commercial success. It sold over one million copies, making Exo the best-selling Korean artist in twelve years. Subsequent albums and EPs have also had strong sales, with all Korean studio albums each selling more than one million copies. Exo has won many awards for their albums, including five consecutive Album of the Year wins at the Mnet Asian Music Awards and two consecutive Artist of the Year wins at the Melon Music Awards . Exo's sixth album Don't Mess Up My Tempo (2018) is their highest-charting album on the US Billboard 200 , debuting at number 23. It is also their best selling album with over 1.9 million copies sold in South Korea. Since Exo's first headlining tour in 2014, the band has performed over 100 concerts across four tours and has participated in multiple joint tours. Exo is also known for its work beyond music, which includes endorsement deals with brands such as Nature Republic and Samsung , and philanthropic efforts such as Smile For U, a joint SM Entertainment and UNICEF project that began in 2015, and in which Exo continues to participate. In 2011, SM Entertainment CEO , Lee Soo-man , revealed plans to debut a new boy band that would be divided into two sub-groups, promoting the same music simultaneously in South Korea and China by performing songs in both Korean and Mandarin. After several member changes in December 2011, the group finalized its name as Exo, taken from the word \" exoplanet \". The news of an upcoming debut from SM Entertainment attracted substantial media attention from within South Korea and internationally, with many comparing Exo to fellow SM boy band TVXQ . It was also reported that Exo would compete with a new girl group from rival YG Entertainment . Exo-K's leader, Suho , was the first member to join SM Entertainment, after a successful audition through the company's casting system in 2006. The following year, Kai , with encouragement from his father, auditioned at the SM Youth Best Contest; he won and received a contract. Chanyeol , who took second place in a Smart Model Contest, and Sehun , who went through four auditions in two years, were the next members to become trainees in 2008. In 2010, Exo-K's D.O. sang for his audition and was eventually offered a contract. The last member of Exo-K to become a trainee was Baekhyun , who joined in 2011 through SM Entertainment's casting system and trained for approximately one year before debut. In Exo-M, Kris auditioned in 2008 at a global SM Entertainment audition in Canada, before moving to South Korea for training. That same year, Lay auditioned in Changsha, China, and subsequently moved to South Korea, while Xiumin attended an audition with his friend and won second place. In 2010, Luhan was scouted by an SM Entertainment representative in Seoul and passed his audition, while Tao was scouted at a talent show. The last member to join Exo-M was Chen , who took part in the casting system in 2011. The band's first televised performance was at the annual SBS Gayo Daejeon event on December 29, 2011. Exo-K and Exo-M debuted with the single \" Mama \" on April 8, 2012, followed by the EP Mama on April 9. The two sub-groups promoted the album separately; Exo-K performed on South Korean music program The Music Trend while Exo-M performed on the Top Chinese Music Awards in Shenzhen on the same day. The Korean version of the EP peaked at number one on South Korea's Gaon Album Chart and at number eight on the Billboard World Albums Chart, while the Mandarin version reached number two on China's Sina Album Chart and number one on various Chinese streaming platforms. Prior its debut, Exo released two singles, titled \"What Is Love\" and \"History\u201d, which peaked at number 88 on and number 68 respectively on the Gaon Digital Chart and at number six on the Sina Music Chart. Exo was awarded Best New Asian Group at the 2012 Mnet Asian Music Awards and the Newcomer Award at the Golden Disc Awards . The group's first studio album, XOXO , was released on June 3, 2013, in two versions: one in Korean and one in Mandarin. Unlike the EP Mama , for which Exo-K and Exo-M had separate promotions, XOXO was jointly promoted, mainly in South Korea. Exo recorded the album's lead single \" Wolf \" together, but the rest of the album tracks were recorded separately. A repackaged version of the album, titled Growl , was released on August 5, 2013, with three additional tracks. New single \"Growl\" peaked at number three on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 and at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. All versions of XOXO collectively sold over one million copies, making Exo the first South Korean artists to reach that milestone in 12 years. That December, Exo released a second EP, Miracles in December , as a special winter album containing the single of the same name. Prior to the release, the group promoted the album through their first reality show, Exo's Showtime , which premiered on November 28, 2013 on the cable channel MBC Every 1 . Following their 2013 releases, Exo won Song of the Year at the Melon Music Awards for \"Growl\", Disc Daesang at the Golden Disc Awards and Album of the Year at the Mnet Asian Music Awards for XOXO , and the Daesang at the Seoul Music Awards . In addition, Exo-M received the Most Popular Group Award at the 2013 Top Chinese Music Awards . Exo's third EP, Overdose , was released on May 7, 2014. Originally scheduled to be released on April 21, the album was delayed due to the Sewol Ferry accident on April 16. Overdose was promoted similarly to Mama , with Exo-K in South Korea and Exo-M promoting primarily in China. The album had over 660,000 pre-orders, making it the most pre-ordered Korean EP in history. The Korean edition also peaked at number two on Billboard ' s World Albums Chart, and at number 129 on the Billboard 200, making Exo the highest-ever charting male Korean group at that time. Overdose became the best selling release of 2014 in South Korea, and was the first EP to top the yearly charts and win the Album of the Year Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . On December 22, Exo released their first live album, Exology Chapter 1: The Lost Planet The album's single, \"December, 2014 (The Winter's Tale)\", peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, making it Exo's first number one single. By the end of 2014, Exo was Japan's best-selling K-pop artist of the year. On May 15, 2014, Kris filed a lawsuit against Sm Entertainment to terminate his contract and alleged that SM: disregarded his health; maintained unfair profit distributions; restricted his freedom; and treated him like a product rather than a person. On May 24, the group began its first headlining tour, \" Exo from Exoplanet 1 \u2013 The Lost Planet \", at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena . Tickets for the concert sold out in 1.47 seconds, breaking the record for the quickest concert sell-out by a Korean artist. On October 10, Luhan also filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment to terminate his contract. He cited health problems and alleged he was treated differently than the band's Korean members. On March 7, 2015, Exo began their second headlining world tour, \" Exoplanet 2 \u2013 The Exo'luxion \", with 70,000 attendees across five nights at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul. The group released its second studio album Exodus on March 30, 2015, in both Korean and Mandarin versions. Domestic pre-orders for the album surpassed 500,000 copies within 24 hours, setting a new record for pre-orders. Lead single \" Call Me Baby \" was released ahead of schedule, on March 27, because versions of the song had been leaked online. The music videos were released four days later; the Korean version later became the most-watched K-pop music video of the first half of 2015. The album spent a record four consecutive weeks at number one on the Gaon Album Chart and sold over a million copies, making it Exo's second album to do so, after XOXO. Exodus won Album of the Year at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards , giving Exo their third consecutive win. In April 2015, Exodus peaked at number 95 on the US Billboard 200, making the group the highest charting Korean artist. Exo also entered Billboard' s Canadian Hot 100 chart at number 98, making them the first K-pop group and second Korean artist to chart there. Tao was absent during promotions for Exodus due to injuries and, on August 24, became the third member to file a lawsuit against SM Entertainment to terminate his contract. This followed social media posts earlier in the year from Tao's father on Chinese social network Weibo , expressing his wish for his son to withdraw from the group and return to China due to health issues and a lack of support for individual career development. SM responded to his legal action with a statement: \"Our company plans to use everything in our power including both Korean and Chinese legal professionals and partners to respond legally both in Korea and China in a multi-faceted manner. We also plan to take legal steps to respond to Tao's illegal promotions and actions.\" Exo released a repackaged version of Exodus , titled Love Me Right , on June 3, 2015. This edition added four new songs, including the single \" Love Me Right \". Due to Tao's absence, the group promoted the song as nine members. That October, Exo became the first artists to hold a dome concert in South Korea; it was called \"Exo \u2013 Love Concert in Dome\", and took place at the Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul. On November 4, 2015, Exo released their Japanese debut single Love Me Right ~romantic universe~ , which contains the Japanese version of \"Love Me Right\" and an original Japanese song titled \"Drop That\". On the day of its release, the album sold 147,000 copies and reached the top of the Oricon chart, becoming the all-time best-selling debut single in Japan by a Korean artist. Five days later, Exo released a special single titled \" Lightsaber \" to promote the movie Star Wars: The Force Awakens ahead of its release in South Korea, as part of a collaboration between SM Entertainment and Walt Disney . On December 10, Exo released its second winter special release and fourth EP, Sing for You , containing the singles \" Sing for You \" and \" Unfair \". The album sold 267,900 copies in its first week, breaking the record for the highest first-week sales by a Korean artist. \"Unfair\" also became the first K-pop song to be featured in the \"Best of the Week\" playlist by Apple Music , and Exo became the first Korean artists to appear on the platform's homepage. Part of the profits from the album were donated to UNICEF 's Smile For U campaign, to support the music education for children in Asia. In December 2015, South Korean entertainment industry leaders ranked Exo at number seven in the top ten pop culture leaders of 2015, the highest rank held by a K-pop artist. On January 5, 2016, SM Entertainment won one of its countersuits against Tao following the ruling of the Intermediate People's Court in Qingdao, China. The company sued Tao over his failure to repay the company after his departure; it released an official statement that said: \"SM has ongoing lawsuits against Exo members Wu Yifan (Kris), Luhan, and Tao for violating their exclusive contracts and partaking in illegal promotions in China. Among these lawsuits, SM filed a lawsuit against Tao for failing to repay SM on October 13, 2015. An intermediate court in Qingdao, China made the verdict that Tao is to repay SM Entertainment as well as interest for the delayed payment.\" Exo's third studio album Ex'Act and its singles, \" Lucky One \" and \" Monster \", were released on June 9, 2016, in both Korean and Mandarin versions. Domestic pre-orders for the album exceeded 660,000 copies, making it the most pre-ordered K-pop album ever at that time. The album broke the record for the highest first-week sales of a Korean album, previously set by the band's own fourth EP Sing For You. \"Monster\" became Exo's first number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, and \"Lucky One\" debuted at number three. On August 18, 2016, a repackaged edition of the album, titled Lotto , was released; it added four new songs, including the single of the same name. \" Lotto \" became Exo's second number one on the Billboard World Digital Songs Chart, and peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart. The repackaged edition's Korean and Mandarin versions reached number one and two on the Gaon Album Chart, respectively Within two months of its original release, Ex'Act had sold over 1.17 million copies, becoming Exo's third album to sell over one million copies, earning them the title of \"triple million sellers\" from the media. On July 21, contractual disputes between Kris and Luhan and SM Entertainment were settled. The two sides settled during their third court-mandated arbitration; the previous two were held in September 2015 and June 2016, when the court settled the case with a recommendation for reconciliation. The singers will maintain their contracts with SM until 2022. SM would contract out their work outside of Korea and Japan; i.e., Kris and Luhan's Chinese agencies will \"share related revenues\" with SM for activities anywhere but Korea and Japan (where SM has exclusive rights per their contract) because SM is technically \"contract[ing] out management\" for its non-Korean/Japanese activities until 2022, when their contracts with SM expire. On July 22, Exo embarked on its third headlining tour, \" Exoplanet 3 \u2013 The Exo'rdium \", with a record six consecutive concerts at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena. On May 28, 2017, the tour ended with the second of two consecutive concerts at the Seoul Olympic Stadium , the largest stadium in South Korea, with an estimated maximum seating capacity of 100,000. Tickets for the first date went on sale on April 12 and were sold out within 20 minutes. The tour brought the band's total number of concerts to over 100. In June, Lay announced he would not take part in the band's next album, and would instead focus on his acting career. Since then, he has been absent from Exo albums and public appearances.

Exo's seventh studio album, Obsession , was released on November 27, 2019. In October 2016, SM Entertainment formed the group's first sub-unit, Exo-CBX (also known as Chen-Baek-Xi), which is composed of three members: Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin. Exo-CBX has released one studio album: Magic (2018) and three extended plays: Hey Mama! (2016), Girls (2017), and Blooming Days (2018). In July 2019, SM Entertainment formed the group's second sub-unit, Exo-SC , which is composed of members Sehun and Chanyeol. They released their first extended play titled What a Life on July 22. Exo are considered by many to be a vocal powerhouse in the K-pop industry; the group's three main vocalists D.O., Chen, and Baekhyun have received praise from industry figures and the media. Beginning in 2013, Exo has released special winter-themed EPs in December nearly every year. These EPs feature many classic, emotional ballads, diverging from the dramatic and upbeat singles usually featured on the band's full-length albums. Billboard applauded the band's single \"Universe\" from the 2017 EP of the same name, saying, \"With soaring, emotive vocals courtesy of the Exo members, 'Universe' is a power ballad that showcases the group's strengths.\" The group has frequently worked with veteran Korean and international producers, including Kenzie , Dean , LDN Noise , The Underdogs , and MARZ Music. Many of Exo's songs \u2013 especially the singles, which blend pop, hip-hop, and R&B with electronic dance music genres like house, trap, and synth-pop\u2013 are produced with onstage performance in mind. Producer Harvey Mason Jr. commented: \"We listen to their material ... and try and go one step further. We try and do things that are fresh and original but yet still sound like Exo. ...They can sing, they can dance, they have the energy ... It's like a painter having every color to paint with.\" Early in their career, Exo were described by Billboard as sounding \"wholly inspired by the late '90s/early '00s sound ... with bigger beats, loads more hooks and adding rap and dance breakdowns.\" The group explored a more \"mature\" and \"dark\" sound in 2016 with the release of their third studio album, Ex'Act , featuring an increased use of electronic dance music styles like house and synth-pop. Their fourth studio album, The War , deepened the group's experimentation with genre, including the addition of trap music. With the album's single \" Ko Ko Bop \", Exo received praise for unconventionally hybridizing laid-back reggae sounds with heavy electronic breaks. Exo's members faced criticism early in their careers because of their lack of involvement in the writing and producing of their songs. However, in 2015 Exo released its first song to credit lyrics to one of the group's members, on the repackaged version of their second album, Love Me Right . \"Promise (Exo 2014)\" was written by Chanyeol, Chen, and Lay, and was a \"special gift\" to the fans, with lyrics thanking them for their support. Since then, Exo has released multiple songs with lyrics by the band's members, including \"Heaven\" and \"She's Dreaming\" from their third album, the special promotional single \"Lightsaber\", and most notably, the hit single \"Ko Ko Bop\" and several other songs from their 2017 album The War . In a 2017 interview with Billboard , Chanyeol spoke about his contributions to the lyrics for \"Chill\", stating that because he \"worked on the lyrics with an empty track without demo lyrics\", the process came more \"naturally\" to him. In the same interview, Chen explained the process of writing their single \"Ko Ko Bop\", saying \"[we] wrote the lyrics separately and worked on putting [them] together for the song afterwards. I don't think I have any regrets [about the song] since it's the best result produced through all the effort that our members and other writers have put into the process.\" Chen is also credited with writing the Korean lyrics for the track \"Lights Out\", from Exo's fourth special winter EP Universe . Lay is also a songwriter and producer, having written and composed each track of all his solo albums as well for other artists. Chanyeol participated in writing lyrics for \"Gravity\" and 'With You\", both off of Exo's sixth studio album Don't Mess Up My Tempo. Exo have been praised particularly for their synchronized choreography and elaborate stage designs. The band was choreographed early in their career by American hip hop choreographers Tony Testa and Nicholas Bass for songs like \"Wolf\" and \"Growl\", respectively. In recent years, Exo has collaborated with choreographer Kim Tae Woo. Dazed admired the band's \"seamless...knife-point choreography\", saying it has put Exo \"at the forefront of pop domination\". A recurring stage element during the group's world tours has been the use of water in the form of rain and shallow pools. Cleo said Exo's \"winning formula\" is the incorporation of water into their choreography, saying \"there was water cascading from above during 'White Noise' and 'Lightsaber', which saw some of the members getting drenched.\" Yahoo wrote that \"during one segment, the boys stood on an elevated hexagon-shaped stage (modeled after the band's logo), and danced sensually while water rained down on them from above.\" On their stage design, Music Mind noted Exo's use of \"not only ... the stage-lights and the lightsticks, but also [a] multitude of special effects like water, flames, and fireworks, not to mention huge screens positioned both on the substage and across the whole perimeter of the venue\". Rappler journalist Keb Cuevas described Exo's \"multi-LED screen stage fitted with holographic Exo embellishments and choreographed laser lighting\", saying \"the stage was literally on fire as pyrotechnic effects were ignited with the electronic beat.\" Covering a 2018 concert in Singapore, Bandwagon remarked that after their \"fourth headlining tour [in] four years ... you might [assume] their setlist and stages would be repetitive and stale. But [that] was not the case at all.\" With the release of their debut studio album in 2013, Exo became the first South Korean artists in 12 years to sell over one million copies of an album; the previous artist prior to reach this milestone was g.o.d , in 2001. In 2018, Exo became \"quintuple million sellers\", meaning the band has sold over one million copies apiece for five different albums. Following the release of their 5th studio album, Don't Mess Up My Tempo , Exo became the first South Korean artist who debuted in the 21st century to sell 10 million albums cumulatively. Exo have also contributed significantly to the financial success of their management agency, SM Entertainment. In the fourth quarter of 2018, Sm Entertainment recorded the largest ever quarterly profit for any South Korean entertainment company at $13.4 million. The SM artist generating the highest revenue was Exo, at 31% of the total $188 million fourth quarter revenue. Exo have been described as \"the biggest boy band in the world\". They have gained immense popularity in South Korea, and were named by Forbes on the Korea Power Celebrity list as the most powerful celebrities in South Korea for 2015 and 2016; within the top five for 2014, 2017, and 2018; and within the top 10 for 2019 They have been given a number of honorific nicknames such as \"Kings of K-Pop\" by international outlets Vogue , Metro , PageOne and South Korean outlets including OBS among others. They were also named as the \"Nation's pick\" and the \"Global pick\" by South Korean media. Exo are widely esteemed as a prominent force in the Hallyu Wave , which refers to the rise and spread of Korean pop culture around the world. When discussing the significance of Exo in a global context, Bustle magazine described them as \"the ultimate K-pop sensation\", saying \"there's really nothing quite like Exo.\" The group has received further attention for releasing almost all of its studio albums simultaneously in both Korean and Mandarin. Vulture described Exo as \"leaders of a K-pop generation\" when describing the band's ability to release music in the Korean and Chinese markets while continuing to impress in the United States with Billboard chartings and arena tours. In this regard, Dazed considered Exo's success to be that of \"a continent-straddling pop juggernaut\". In 2016, AsiaOne said \"Exo are turning into an omnipresent, unstoppable global force,\" citing their popularity in the United States, their critical acclaim, and the size of their global fandom. In April 2018, Forbes described Exo as one of the two artists worldwide that dramatically over-perform on social media, with the other being fellow K-pop boy band BTS . Both groups exceeded the reach of American artists such as Beyonce , Justin Bieber and Taylor Swift . Twitter statistics from Next Big Sound , show that with 24 million mentions in one week, Exo recorded 14,000 times more than expected. Exo also ranked at number two on the 2018 Billboard Social 50 end of year ranking. Exo's work has influenced numerous artists, including MVP , Kim Dong-han , NCT 127 , Wanna One , and Kang Daniel . Exo has maintained numerous endorsement deals throughout the group's career, and has been named multiple times as having the most powerful brand reputation among K-pop artists by the Korean Business Research Institute. Since 2012, Exo has maintained a partnership with Samsung , the largest public company in South Korea, where the group has endorsed the company's electronic products. In early February 2013, Exo began promoting the South Korean clothing brand Kolon Sport, for which they filmed a commercial for a new pair of sneakers named for their collaboration: MOVE-XO. Also in 2013, Exo began a two-year endorsement deal with cosmetics brand Nature Republic , which was later extended and remains active to this day. Their partnership grew in 2015 and 2016 to include autograph events, which drew 30,000 and 50,000 fans, respectively. The 2015 autograph event was held in Busan , with crowds such that the municipal police department tweeted: \"Currently live from Exo's fan signing in Gwangbukdong. One, two three! We Are One! Busan Police! Everyone, please be in order.\" These events were followed by the Green Nature Exo Fan Festival in 2017 and 2018; both were concert-style events hosted by Nature Republic with thousands of attendees. In late 2015, Exo officially endorsed Star Wars: The Force Awakens with the release of a collaboration film that featured \"the nine Exo members in a Star Wars-inspired world where clubs are 'Jedi Only' and they carry lightsabers\", according to Billboard . In 2016, the group became ambassadors for American footwear company Skechers , endorsing the D'Lites 2 Sweet Monster Collection. This partnership has extended to Skechers events such as the 2017 Sweet Monster K-Pop Dance Competition, attended by Exo members Chanyeol and Sehun. Also in 2016, the group became the official faces of international clothing brand SPAO's spring collection, which included limited-edition postcards and posters for customers. In 2018, in the lead-up to Exo's performance at the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Winter Olympics, the group became the faces of the Switzerland-based snow-sports company Kessler. In March 2018, Exo were announced to be the new brand ambassadors for Major League Baseball (MLB) in Asia.

In 2015, Exo began participating in Smile For U, a joint SM Entertainment and UNICEF project that supports music education for children in Asia. Part of the proceeds from the band's second special winter release Sing for You and multiple subsequent albums were donated to the campaign. Exo have won numerous awards in South Korea and internationally. On June 14, 2013, the band earned their first-ever music show win, with the single \"Wolf\" on Korea's Music Bank . Music programs are weekly television shows in South Korea and China that award the artist with the most popular song in the country based on digital chart performance, album sales and social media popularity.

Exo have gone on to win over 100 music program awards, becoming the second act to do so after their label-mates Girls' Generation .

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon_Pop", "name": "Crayon Pop", "labels": ["Chrome Entertainment", "Sony Music", "Pony Canyon"], "intro": " Crayon Pop ( Hangul : \ud06c\ub808\uc6a9\ud31d) is a South Korean girl group formed under Chrome Entertainment in 2012. The group consists of four members: Geummi, Ellin, Choa, and Way. Their fifth member, Soyul, left the group in 2017. Crayon Pop officially debuted in July 2012 with their performance of \"Saturday Night\" on Mnet 's M! Countdown . Their first EP was not a commercial success, and when their song \"Dancing Queen\" was released in October, the group had few opportunities to promote on music shows . Instead they held guerrilla performances on the streets of Seoul, which helped increase their fanbase. Crayon Pop gained a huge increase in popularity following the release of their single album \" Bar Bar Bar \" in June 2013. The group's unique stage outfits and choreography gained public attention, and made the title song a viral hit. It eventually managed to reach number 1 on Billboard 's K-Pop Hot 100 . Crayon Pop was able to earn numerous awards, including the New Rising Star Award at the Golden Disk Awards , the Hot Trend Award at the MelOn Music Awards , and Best New Female Artist at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . The group has held solo concerts in South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, and has also performed in other countries including Australia and China. Throughout June and July 2014, the group was an opening act Lady Gaga 's ArtRave: The Artpop Ball concert tour. Crayon Pop performed for it in 12 cities around the United States and Canada. Following their appearance in the Artpop tour, the group debuted their first subunit in October. The unit is named Strawberry Milk, and consists of the twin members Choa and Way. In March 2015, Crayon Pop released their second mini album FM , for which they used Super Sentai inspired costumes. They released the song \"RaRiRuRe\" in June of that same year, which was their debut in the Japanese music market. The group continued their Japanese promotions with their second single \"Dancing All Night\" in November. Their first Japanese studio album Crayon Pop was released January 2016, and it ranked #11 on Oricon's Daily Album Charts . Crayon Pop collaborated with Mexican boy band CD9 in August, to release the song \"Get Dumb\". In September, Crayon Pop released the song \"Vroom Vroom\" ahead of their first album Crayon Pop Evolution Pop Vol. 1 . They soon released the music video for \"Doo Doom Chit\", another song that would feature on the track list of the album. On 19 April 2017, the group announced their contracts with Chrome Media had ended in March and they had gone their separate ways, although they would not be officially disbanding. On 30 May, it was revealed that Way, Choa, Geummi and Ellin would continue to promote as Crayon Pop under Chrome Entertainment, but Soyul had chosen to leave the group. The group was initially named Hurricane Pop, and consisted of members Serang (Yang Se-hyeon), Geummi (Baek Bo-ram), Ellin (Kim Min-young), Choa (Heo Min-jin), and Soyul (Park Hye-kyeong). Chrome Entertainment's CEO, Hwang Hyun-chang, did not consider candidates who were taller than 165\u00a0cm or had a sexy image, because he wanted a group of ordinary girls. Soyul was the first member to be accepted, and Geummi was the next to join. Serang, under the name Mari, had formerly been the leader of the disbanded girl group Coin Jackson. Ellin was referred to Chrome Entertainment by Chrome's dance choreographer and was accepted after her third audition. Choa was recommended to the company by Way, her twin sister. Way had been invited to audition, but was unable to do so because she was a member of the indie band N.Dolphin. Singer Bumkey was involved in the audition process and also supervised the group's vocal training. The group recorded their first song 'Bing Bing' as Hurricane Pop. In January 2012, they performed the song live for the first time in Hangzhou , China. The performance of 'Bing Bing' was filmed for the Chinese television drama Curry Campus . A music video for their song was filmed in February, but Serang left the group in May to pursue an acting career. After Serang's departure, Way was given another chance to join the group and she left N.Dolphin. Shortly before their debut the group's name was changed to Crayon Pop, as Chrome Entertainment thought the name Hurricane Pop would be insensitive in light of Japan's tsunamis . The members' stage names were chosen by the company's CEO, although several of them had input into the choice. Crayon Pop began their promotions in Japan in May 2012, using their time there to film music videos for \"Bing Bing\". The group released both the Korean and Japanese music videos in June. The music video for their debut single \"Saturday Night\" was released on 17 July, followed by a Japanese version, as well as an alternate version with new footage, on 24 July. Crayon Pop's first EP , Crayon Pop 1st Mini Album , was released digitally on 18 July and included both \"Bing Bing\" and \"Saturday Night\". The group made their official stage debut the following day on 19 July, performing \"Saturday Night\" on Mnet 's M! Countdown . Crayon Pop's debut did not receive much attention and their album was not commercially successful. Chrome Entertainment's CEO later revealed that the album had depleted all the company's money. Crayon Pop released a digital single album, \"Dancing Queen\", on 24 October 2012. Besides the title track, it also included a remixed version of \"Bing Bing\". In order to stand out from other girl groups, Crayon Pop wore tracksuits instead of more feminine clothing. After seeing a performance of \"Dancing Queen\", Kangin and Shindong of Super Junior praised the song and group, with Shindong saying \"I'd love to produce a girl group like them\". Crayon Pop was only invited to perform on music shows three times, and they were not able to have a typical promotion cycle. As a result, they took to the streets and promoted \"Dancing Queen\" with guerrilla performances, which often took place in extremely cold weather. Chrome Entertainment also produced a reality web series about the group, titled Crayon Pop TV . Through these activities, Crayon Pop developed a loyal fanbase, especially of \"uncle fans\" called \"Pop-jeossi\" (from the Korean word ajeossi ). Crayon Pop returned to Japan and held a mini-concert on 6 January 2013 in Shibuya, Tokyo . Tickets went on sale on 11 December 2012, and sold out in less than an hour. As a result of considerable demand from fans unable to purchase tickets, Chrome Entertainment announced that another Japanese concert would be held at a later date, and a second mini-concert was staged in Osaka on 22 February. On 25 January, Crayon Pop began promoting the remixed version of \"Bing Bing\", which included a popping dance break to Daft Punk 's \" Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger \" instead of the original rap verse. They had a \"delinquent schoolgirl\" concept with new choreography, and wore tracksuits or school uniforms with tracksuit pants. On 19 May, a third Japanese mini-concert was held in Shibuya, Tokyo. A new Japanese member, Arisa, was to be revealed at this concert, but she had withdrawn from the group before the performance. On 8 June, Crayon Pop performed a preview version of their new song \" Bar Bar Bar \". The unusual dance featured choreographed jumping, and they wore scooter helmets, polo shirts, and tracksuit pants with skirts. A story version music video was released on 13 June, a week before the song's digital release on 20 June. Three days later, a dance version music video was released. Filmed with a budget of only 380,000 won (US$347), the music video went viral and Crayon Pop drew interest due to their unique stage outfits and choreography. This music video has more than 51 million views on YouTube as of April 2019. As \"Bar Bar Bar\" went viral, it began to climb the Korean digital music charts, eventually reaching the upper positions of most major real time chart listings. It stayed at the top of Billboard 's Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart for more than a month, and ranked number 1 for the first time eight weeks after release. \"Bar Bar Bar\" solidified its viral status when a parody video was aired on a segment of SNL Korea on 13 August. That same day, it was announced that Crayon Pop had signed a contract with Sony Music Entertainment , who were inspired by the groups' creativity and uniqueness and saw their global market potential. Crayon Pop scored their first music show win when \"Bar Bar Bar\" won first place on Music Bank on 30 August, beating EXO 's \" Growl \". On 9 September, a \"Global Version\" music video was released ahead of Crayon Pop's second mini album, The Streets Go Disco , which was released on 26 September under the Sony Music label. This album consisted of their four previous singles and remixes of those songs. A music video for the title track, \"Dancing Queen 2.0\", was released along with the album. \"Bar Bar Bar\" earned Chrome Entertainment US$2 million in the year after its release, and Crayon Pop was able to move from their small row house in Nonhyeon-dong to a luxury \"villa\" apartment due to their increased income. Crayon Pop's rising popularity also brought them criticism. Netizens accused the group of being affiliated with the right-wing website Ilbe after Way used the phrase nomu nomu (\ub178\ubb34\ub178\ubb34) on Twitter. This phrase was popularized on Ilbe and was used to criticize former president Roh Moo-hyun . It was then discovered that Chrome Entertainment's CEO previously mentioned the website on Twitter. CEO Hwang responded by saying he was registered on many popular online communities, including Ilbe, in order to gather information about singers and girl groups. He also stated that Way's phrase was an example of aegyo and she was not even aware of the website. However, the controversy continued and several of the group's scheduled events were cancelled after criticism from the public. Online auction company Auction stopped broadcasting its new TV commercial featuring Crayon Pop after widespread customer complaints. The controversy resurfaced in January 2014 after Ellin allegedly used the Ilbe hand sign, but Chrome Entertainment explained that Ellin was forming the letter \"E\" with her hand, and all the Crayon Pop members have alphabet hand signs that signify their names. Due to Crayon Pop's increased popularity, they had more opportunities to perform. On 27 July, they held their first mini-concert in South Korea.

On 1 February 2017, Chrome Entertainment released a statement discussing Crayon Pop's impending contract expirations, announcing their contracts would expire in March and they had previously not discussed the issue of re-signing with the company.

While disbandment was not confirmed, the members would be focusing on their solo careers, in effect putting the group on indefinite hiatus. Chrome Entertainment later released a statement contradicting this, saying Way's contract ended in May, not in March as previously stated. On 8 May, it was confirmed that although both parties had repeatedly denied the rumours of a pregnancy and shotgun marriage, Soyul was pregnant and would be giving birth to a girl the same month. On 31 May, an announcement was made that Geummi, Ellin, Choa and Way signed a non-exclusive contract under Chrome Entertainment to promote as Crayon Pop, however their solo careers would be managed by other labels. The statement specified that the group would be on a hiatus while the members worked on their solo careers. It was also revealed Soyul had withdrawn from the group to focus on her new family.

All of them, with the exception of Ellin, were featured on KBS2's The Return of Superman , where Soyul's family are regular cast members. Crayon Pop's music is often described as electropop and disco-pop dance music with addictive and repetitive lyrics and melodies. Their first single, \"Saturday Night\", was a 1980s -inspired \"electro-pop dance song with a retro melody\". After the release of \"Bar Bar Bar\", Corynn Smith of MTV called Crayon Pop \"a disco-pop K-Pop group that is obviously having a blast\" with \"bafflingly simple lyrics and unexpected choreography.\" Pops in Seoul described \" Lonely Christmas \" as \"a dance song with funk and disco sounds\", while Billboard magazine noted the song's catchy hook and energetic synths, trumpets and guitars. Crayon Pop's sixth single, \"Uh-ee\", is a mix of electronic sounds and trot . Chrome Entertainment called the genre \" house electronic trot\" because it \"is composed of fast beats and strong electronic sounds with addictive trot melody\". Billboard described the song as having a hyper- techno dance beat that would fit into Dance Dance Revolution , while the dance routine was \"more like an intense aerobic workout than a silly dance\". Strawberry Milk ( Korean : \ub538\uae30 \uc6b0\uc720 ; RR : Ttalgiuyu ) is Crayon Pop's first subgroup, featuring twins Choa and Way. Chrome Entertainment announced the subgroup (also called a unit or sub-unit) on 29 September 2014. Their debut album, The 1st Mini Album , was released on 15 October, along with a music video for the title track, \"OK\". Another song on the album, \"Let Me Know\", was written by Way.

In April 2015, Choa and Way were featured on Kim Yoo-min's \"Road\" (\uae38), the lead single from his debut mini album (released under the stage name, Bear Planet). The sisters also played two of the lead roles in the music video. On 13 January 2016, the sisters released the single \"I Hate You\" (\ub098\uac00 \ubbf8\uc6cc). On 2 July, they released the single \"Always\" ( \ub298 ) for the soundtrack of the television drama Mirror of the Witch .

The group's name stems from the idea that each member is reminiscent of a different type of chocolate . The name of the group was initially going to be \"Chocolate\", but there was already a group with that name, so Paramount Music decided to use the French word chocolat instead. The group consists of mixed race members. The group became inactive in 2013. Melanie confirmed in an interview that the group members' contracts had concluded in February 2017 and the group had disbanded. On August 2, 2011, Chocolat was revealed to the public by Paramount Music as the first mixed race group to debut in South Korea. Prior to their debut, their music had been described as electronic club music, a mix of the disco of T-ara 's \" Roly-Poly \" and the club sounds of 2NE1 's \"I Am The Best\". They have also said their role models are from girl group 2NE1. The song \"I Like It\" was brought to the group at the last-minute by the Paramount's president, thinking that it better represented the group's image. At this point, the band had already recorded seven songs and were rehearsing another song for their debut. At first, the song was not well-liked, but public reception made them more comfortable with it. The music video for \"Syndrome\" was released on August 16, prior to the release of the digital single. Following the digital release of the single on August 17, Chocolat had their debut performance on Mnet's M! Countdown on August 18, 2011, later performing on August 19, 2011 on KBS Music Bank , on August 20, 2011 on MBC Music Core and finally a week later on SBS Inkigayo , on September 4, 2011. The song peaked at number 68 on the Gaon Weekly Digital Singles Chart and was written by British songwriter group DWB (Paul Drew, Greig Watts, Pete Barringer). Before the debut, the group also had a cameo in the film Mr. Idol as \"Korea's best group\". Later in the year, it was revealed that the group would be returning with an extended play in December. Promotions for \"I Like It\" began on December 3, 2011 at the music show K-pop Con . Due to severe illness, member Jaeyoon was unable to attend recording sessions for the title track and therefore had to miss the \"I Like It\" promotional period altogether. The EP contains a total of five songs, including the title track \"I Like It\", which is work of Girls' Generation 's Genie 's songwriters Anne Judith Wik, Robin Jenssen, Ronny Svendsen and Nermin Harambasic . Writer team DWB, having previously composed their debut single, composed the EP's track \"In a Heartbeat\" (\ub108\ub9cc\uc744 \ubcf4\uace0 \ub108\ub9cc\uc744 \uadf8\ub9ac\ub294) and \"World Domination\" (\uc2eb\uc5b4 \uc2eb\uc5b4). The EP was released on December 15, 2011, including their title track \"I Like It\", an English version of the single, and three other tracks, likely to have been amongst the seven previously recorded songs the group had prior to debuting. The EP reached 63 on the Gaon Weekly Albums Chart, while the title track went to number 81 on the digital singles chart. On January 5, it was announced that Chocolat had been chosen as new models for NBA Korea. On January 21, through Twitter , member Tia announced that they wouldn't be going back home to celebrate the Korean New Year and would instead spend the holiday practicing for promotions for their follow-up single \"One More Day\". The track, from their I Like It EP, was penned by Korean-American songwriters Jenny Hyun and Jean T. Na, and was originally sung as a demo by Hyun and titled \"Same Thing To Her\". The first performance for \"One More Day\" was broadcast through KBS 's Music Bank on February 3. The music video was then released on February 9, 2012, alongside the physical and digital single album, which included the title track, a B-side song titled \"Get Up\", as well as instrumentals of both songs. The music video shows the members performing a chair dance contrasting with the storyline involving the girls capturing the man who's deceived them and punishing him for what he's done. The single reached number 83 on the Gaon Weekly Digital Singles Chart. The song is scheduled to be used as a theme song for a movie currently being filmed in the United States. On May 29, it was confirmed that Chocolat would be releasing new material in June. A week earlier the members had been reported to have been filming their upcoming music video for their comeback. The group has since been a four-membered unit, as their former main vocalist Jaeyoon continued her absence from activities. The new single, \"Black Tinkerbell\", is about the love of Peter Pan 's fairy, Tinkerbell , who stays by his side although he has found a love of his own, Wendy. The track was composed by Kim Euisung, a member of the group Bring The Noiz, who was inspired to write the song for Chocolat after hearing people compare them to fairies. The song took almost two years to be written, and the recording took six months to be perfected. The single also includes a B-side, \"All Night Long\", composed by the DWB songwriting team. On June 5, Chocolat performed a preview of \"Black Tinkerbell\" for the first time on Arirang TV's Afterschool Club . After a one-year-and-three-month hiatus, the group released the single and its music video on June 11, 2013 in South Korea.

Champion on June 13, followed by Music Bank on June 14. \"Black Tinkerbell\" reached number 81 on the Gaon charts. On February 3, 2017, Tia officially announced her departure from the group. On April 14, 2017, Melanie did an interview with the website 'Kpopalypse' when she confirmed that the groups' contracts had officially concluded as of February 2017 saying that \"It was a long time coming. I mean a really long time coming, I wanna say maybe since the beginning of the group, I saw it coming\".

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_B", "name": "Block B", "labels": ["Stardom", "Seven Seasons"], "intro": "Block B ( Korean : \ube14\ub77d\ube44 ) is a South Korean boy band created by Cho PD in 2011. The group debuted with seven members: Taeil , B-Bomb , Jaehyo , U-Kwon , Park Kyung , Zico , and P.O . In February 2011, Cho PD announced that he would be spending $1.4 million USD to create a seven-member hip hop group under his \"Creating Korea's Eminem Project\". On April 13, 2011, their debut music video for \"Freeze!\" was released, but banned by the Commission of Youth Protection because they felt that it was too sexy for Korean television. As a result, the song could not be sold to minors under the age of 19, and the video could not be aired before 10 pm. On April 15, 2011, Block B made their live debut on KBS Music Bank . The group followed up with another track, \"Wanna B\". A mini album, New Kids on the Block , was released on June 23, 2011. On June 22, 2011, the first episode of MTV's eight-episode series Match Up! was aired featuring Block B and B1A4 . On October 16, 2011 MTV started airing a series of specials for the Match Up series that followed Block B as they promoted in Japan. Welcome to the Block , their second mini album, ran into some controversy: two songs from the album were banned as inappropriate for minors by The Ministry of Gender Equality and Family (MOGEF) and KBS. In February 2012, Block B came under fire for behaving inappropriately during an interview that had taken place in Thailand a month earlier. They made offensive remarks regarding the flood disaster that was taking place and were criticized by other celebrities and the media. In response, the members issued letters of apology and released a video on their record company's YouTube channel. As result of this incident, leader of Block B, Zico, also shaved his head to demonstrate his remorse. Block B returned in October 2012 with their first full-length album, Blockbuster . The title track \"Nillili Mambo\" was well received and ranked number 10 on Billboard' s World Albums Chart. On January 3, it was reported that Block B had filed a suit against their agency to ask for their exclusive contract to be nullified. According to media reports, the Block B members filed against Stardom at the Seoul Central District Court, stating, \"During the signing of the exclusive contract, it was promised that in addition to providing proper training opportunity and facilities, we would be paid on every 25th of the following month\u2026However, the agency has not paid us for nearly one year since April 2011.\" (It's not clear whether it is 2011 or 2012 since the quote in the article states that it is nearly a year, but April 2011 would be well over a year). \"It started last year in March when one member's contract was ended and his portion of the pay was calculated\u2026 Appearance fees from events as well as pay from SBS drama 'Phantom's OST, MBC drama 'Golden Time' OST, and funds collected from the inauguration of our Japanese fan site's fan club, and more for a total of 10 things, have been omitted.\" They added, \"The CEO of the agency, Mr. Lee, has also disappeared with the 70,000,000 KRW (~66,000 USD) that he collected from the members' parents.\" On May 20, 2013, it was reported that Mr. Lee had committed suicide. On June 7, 2013, the court ruled in favour of the company, saying \"It's difficult to see the company not being able to pay the group as intentional. From the evidence provided so far, it is difficult to claim that the label purposely did not pay Block B. It is also difficult to say that the label did not provide proper facilities such as studios and dorms, and it is also difficult to say that they did not provide education and guidance. From written records, it cannot be said that Stardom Entertainment violated their management obligations. There is a possibility that the musical income of 430,000,000 KRW (approximately $385,000 USD) and the event income of 5,000,000 KRW (approximately $4,500 USD) was not properly taken care of. However, from just the evidence provided, it cannot be said that the label purposely kept the money from the members.\" Block B issued a statement in response to the ruling, apologising to fans and saying they would no longer be working with Stardom Entertainment. The group also said that they would be contesting the ruling, and were preparing independent promotions. On August 29, 2013, Block B announced that they had negotiated the transfer of their rights from Stardom to a new management company, Seven Seasons. A representative from Seven Seasons said that the group was planning to release a new album in October. Seven Seasons created a YouTube channel on which they uploaded Block B videos. On August 31, 2013, Seven Seasons released U-Kwon's teaser video, which featured him jogging through urban Seoul, with the question \"Do you wanna B?\" at the end. Following that was Jaehyo and P.O 's teaser released on September 4, showing the two suiting up. That teaser also ended with the question: \"Do you wanna B?\" On September 17, 2013, Block B announced their pre-released single via Seven Seasons' YouTube channel.

The album itself topped the Gaon chart and led Apink to reach their highest-ever position on Billboard's World Albums chart at No. 11.

Billboard have chosen the title track as one of 20 Best K-Pop Songs of 2018, noting that \"it felt a bit meta -- as the six-member girl group swapped out their girlish image for something far more compelling.\".

On January 7, Apink released their eighth mini album Percent , along with the single \"%%(Eung Eung)\", composed by frequent collaborator Black Eyed Pilseung and Jeon Goon. The single, which continued the new direction taken by the group with \"I'm So Sick\", topped several music charts in South Korea after its release and peaked at No. 17 on the Gaon digital chart, while the album reached No. 3 on the Korean chart and No. 14 on the Billboard World Albums chart. To promote the new album, Apink performed \"%%(Eung Eung)\" on various music shows, along with B-side track \"Hug Me\", for a period of two weeks beginning on January 9. On March 13, 2020, Play M Entertainment announced that Apink would be making a comeback some time in April. Apink's image and music style are often compared to first-generation idol girl groups S.E.S. and Fin.K.L . Apink has an innocent and girlish image, unusual among girl groups' sexy concepts. In 2012, member Oh Ha-young said, \"Other girl groups these days tend to highlight their dancing skills and sexy looks, but our concept was an innocent and pure image. I think that's why the audience felt comfortable with us\". However, with releases like 2014's \" Luv \" and 2015's \" Remember \" group deviated, and showed a more mature and sensitive side to the group while still retaining their trademark innocence. Apink's music generally fits within the bubblegum pop genre, with signature cheery lyrics. Jeff Benjamin of Billboard commented that \" My My \" recalled early 2000s bubblegum pop, \" NoNoNo \" was influenced by 1980s synth-pop and \" Luv \" recalls 1990s hip-hop while blending it with ballad melancholy, a fall-themed song of lost love. \" Mr Chu \", released in spring 2014, continues a slew of Apink's trademark bubblegum series which is 'very Apink'. Meanwhile, title track \" Remember \" is a 'cheery synth-pop tune that reminisces about a love during the summertime,' and 'features a quick rhythm and vintage sound to beat the summer heat,'. Their 2016 title track, \" Only One \" is described as mature, blending in mid tempo R&B and dance-pop with subtle hip-hop beats while song like \" Boom Pow Love \" shows a far more urban-pop, energetic vibe with pulsing beats compared to their previous hits. With the release of 2018's \"I'm So Sick\", Apink showed a shift in their style of music, moving towards a more mature and sophisticated sound. The track, with its use of autotune, synth and house beats, and its lyrical content of having 'not even one' bit of feeling left for an ex, makes \"I'm So Sick\" a much bolder track than what Apink is known to put out. 2019's \"%%(Eung Eung)\" does much of the same. Its use of 'izzy snyths, snapping beats, and slapping percussion as the members sing about the type of person one should love' make\u00a0%%(Eung Eung) another song that is a departure from much of Apink's earlier work. Korean Tours Japan Tours Asia Tours American Tours Apink started with a documentary program titled Apink News , which aired on the cable channel TrendE for three seasons (2011\u20132012).

The band's final lineup consisted of Seo Youngjun (Jun), Lee Kyumin (Kei) and Kim Hyoseok (AKi) The part \"Led\" in LEDApple stood for \"Logic Egoism Delete\" and was promoted during their debut but they stopped referring to it since their CODA mini-album was released. Instead they replaced it with a practical explanation of \"shining as brightly as LED whenever they perform\" which was eventually referred to as a tribute to their role-model, Led Zeppelin . The word \"Apple\" in the band's name is supposed to represent their fresh image as idols and fresh music that they release. On August 16, 2015 it was announced that the band would be changing their name to LedT starting on September 1, 2015. The band made their debut on October 6, 2010 with their promotional single, \"Dash\" ( Korean : \ub300\uc26c ), a remake of Baek Ji-young 's song of the same name.

The band's first mini-album, Niga Mwonde and lead single of the same name were released on June 15, 2011 alongside two different music videos; a regular version and a drama version. However, the band faced another controversy after many internet communities claimed that Led Apple's single \"Niga Mwonde\" had plagiarized CN Blue 's song, \"Love\". However, Starkim Entertainment later released a statement addressing the plagiarism issue, stating that both songs were composed by Lee Sang-ho which is why they sounded similar. Niga Mwonde peaked at number sixty-seven on the Gaon Chart . On July 19, 2011, Led Apple released their second promotional single from the mini-album Niga Mwonde , \"Birthday Killer\". The song was released in an attempt to make anti-fans realise that their hate comments can cause idols to do extreme things out of their misery.

In mid-2009, Jaejoong , Yoochun and Junsu (then-members of group TVXQ) filed a lawsuit against SM Entertainment , arguing that the 13-year length and structure of their exclusive contracts as well as the terms of profit distribution were unilaterally disadvantageous towards the artists and should be invalidated. The Seoul Central District Court in October 2009 ruled in their favor affirming their right to independently engage in entertainment activities and granted them injunction suspending the SM contracts; its ruling emphatically pointed out it was a \"subjugating contract\" with terms that are grossly incompatible with Korean labor and contract law. The three members of JYJ continued their activities in Japan for over half a year after the filing of the injunction until their Japanese agency, Avex, unilaterally suspended their activities in 2010 and gave its support to the remaining two members of the original group.

With Daniel's marijuana scandal, the group was put on hiatus.

Their agency explained the decision of name change, commenting, \u201cIt is unheard of for a group who is promoting to change their name. However, it was a decision that was made after much thought to give off a different and more mature image than the original Dalmatian.\u201d Member Daniel is said to have come up with the words that DMTN stands for himself.

Daniel was charged with using, distributing, and selling marijuana, along with other celebrities, back in March 2013. He admitted to all charges and received a one-year jail sentence in October. He made an appeal and began his seven trial appeal in December. During his appeal, Daniel had asked for forgiveness saying that, \u201cIf you show me mercy, I will become a young man that is an asset to this country. Please forgive me.\u201d His sister also promised to move to the United States to watch over him as he attends an American university. Daniel\u2019s sister and his friends were present when they received the reduced sentencing, and celebrated with relieved tears. Following his marijuana scandal, Daniel stepped down from his MC position on Arirang TV 's Pops in Seoul . In light of Daniel's scandal and trial, 2Works Entertainment had decided to put the group on a hiatus since 2013. 2Works Entertainment has commented that \"For the time being, it's hard to make any decisions until Daniel's trial is over. The members currently carrying out activities will continue with them.\" Furthermore, the company denied rumors of Daniel leaving the group, or the group continuing on without him by clarifying that \"we have never thought about group activities without Danny.\" It ultimately culminated in the de facto disbandment of DMTN.
