The group consisted of five members at the time of its debut in 2007: Sunye , Sohee , Hyuna , Sunmi and Yeeun . Shortly after, in the same year, Hyuna left the group due to concerns over her health, which led to the addition of Yubin as replacement. In 2010, Sunmi left the group to pursue an academic career, and trainee Hyerim was selected as her replacement. Sohee departed from the group in late 2013 following the expiration of her contract with JYP Entertainment, while Sunye left the group in late 2014; their departures were officially announced in July 2015. For the group's 2015 comeback, Sunmi returned to the group, and served as a member alongside Yeeun, Yubin, and Hyerim; the Wonder Girls remained as four-piece band until their disbandment in 2017.\n"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kara_(South_Korean_band)", "name": "Kara (South Korean group)", "labels": ["DSP"], "intro": "Kara ( Hangul : \uce74\ub77c, Japanese : \u30ab\u30e9, often stylized as KARA ) / \u02c8 k \u0251\u02d0r \u0259 / was a South Korean pop girl group formed by DSP Media in 2007. The group's final lineup was composed of Park Gyuri , Han Seungyeon , Goo Hara and Heo Youngji . Members Nicole Jung and Kang Ji-young officially departed from the group in 2014, while Kim Sung-hee left in 2008. The group originally started off as a quartet and made their debut with \"Break It\" (2007) while displaying a strong female image and a mature R&B sound. Expectations for the group were big because they were considered as successors to their senior labelmate, Fin.K.L . They released their first studio album titled The First Blooming in March 2007. However, their debut was not well received by the public and was a commercial failure. The following year, Kim Sung-hee departed the group due to parental pressure, and members Goo Hara and Kang Jiyoung were brought in. After their addition, the group also changed their musical style and their image to the \"pretty but natural\" appeal, releasing their first mini-album, Rock U in July 2008. They achieved their first number one song with \" Honey \" (2009). In July 2009, the group released their second studio album, Revolution and spawned the hit single \" Mister \", whose choreography featured the \"butt-dance\", that helped increase the group's popularity within East Asia. Their follow-up singles including \" Lupin \" (2010), \" Jumping \" (2010), \" Step \" (2011), and \"Pandora\" (2012) were also successful and helped further establish the group within the Korean music industry. The group were ranked at No. 6 and No. 5 in Gallup Korea in 2009 and 2010 respectively, thus making them the second best girl group in Korea for 2010. They were also ranked at No. 4 and 13 in February 2012 and 2013's Forbes Korea Power Celebrity list. After finding national success, the group began to expand their music to Japan by signing to Universal Music Japan 's subsidiary label, Universal Sigma in 2010. The group's debut was a success as they were dubbed as \"Japan's No. 1 Rookie Artist of 2010\" by Oricon and also receiving the \"New Artist of the Year Award (International)\" from the Japan Gold Disc Awards . In April 2011, the group achieved their first number one single in Japan with \" Jet Coaster Love \", making them the first foreign female group since the creation of the Oricon to rank number one in the first week of release and also the first foreign female group in thirty years to do so. Overall, the group managed to sell over one million physical singles within two years, making them one of the fastest-selling South Korean acts in Japan. In 2014, Nicole Jung and Kang Jiyoung decided not to renew their contracts with DSP Media thus leaving the group to pursue their own endeavors; Nicole debuted as solo artist and Jiyoung became an actress in Japan. Following their departures, a reality show titled Kara Project was aired on TV to select members to join the group. Seven trainees from DSP Media took part in the program. The winner of the competition was Heo Youngji who became the latest member to join the group. On January 15, 2016, Kara disbanded after DSP Media announced that the contracts with Park Gyu-ri, Han Seung-yeon and Goo Ha-ra expired and they decided not to renew their contracts. Members Gyuri and Youngji have mentioned the possibilities of reunion, though no further updates have been released. The group's name comes from the Greek word \"chara\" (\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac, lit. \"joy\"), which they interpreted to mean \"sweet melody\". The group started off as a quartet with members consisting of Park Gyuri , Han Seung-yeon , Kim Sung-hee, and Jung Nicole . The group debuted on March 29, 2007 with \"Break It\" on M.net 's M! Countdown from their first album The First Blooming while displaying a strong female image and R&B sound. The album also produced the singles \"If U Wanna\" and \"Secret World\". Music videos for the first two singles were created. They were often compared to their senior labelmates, Fin.K.L , because of their similarity and the fact that the two groups were signed to the same label. Additionally, each individual member of Kara was paralleled to a member of Fin.K.L. In response to the comparisons, the group stated that they regarded the comparison as beneficial and inspiring. Although their album was acclaimed by critics, it was not well received by the general public and was overshadowed by other girl groups who debuted the same year. All promotions for their first album ended in the summer of 2007. In August 2007, the group came out with a documentary on M.net called Kara Self Camera which showcased the group and their talents, as well as the relationship they had with each other. The first season debuted on August 8, 2007, and chronicled the lives of the girls over 15 episodes, ending on December 12, 2007. As their first album was not a commercial success, member Seungyeon participated in many television variety shows in the following months to keep the group's name recognizable to the public. The group was scheduled to have their comeback in March 2008 with their second album, however, member Kim Sung-hee suddenly announced that she would be leaving the group due to parental pressure because her participation in the group was contingent on the maintenance of her grades. In response, DSP stated that the second album that was recorded would be shelved and replaced by a mini-album to come in May; in addition, two members would join the group. Auditions were held, and the two new members were eventually revealed to be Goo Ha-ra and Kang Jiyoung .

During their first national performance on KBS 's Music Bank , member Goo Hara accidentally gasped \"ah!\" live on air due to slipping on falling confetti, and reportedly cried profusely afterwards. The incident became a hot issue to many viewers, but Goo Hara received comfort instead of criticism from the general public. Park Gyuri attributed their popularity increase to their \"pretty but natural\" appeal, while media reports gave credit to the band for finally finding its own identity in the music industry since the group's debut and to older male fans, most notably singer Shin Hae Chul . Due to their increasingly hectic schedule as their popularity rose, a few of the group's members were taken to the hospital on December 19 after a Music Bank rehearsal for cold symptoms and exhaustion.

The dolls were sold in South Korea and Japan. They were produced by professionals from Hot Toys, DC Comics, Nokia, and Enterbay.

On June 18, 2012, the group released their own premium fragrance line called \"K5J\", an acronym for \"Kara 5 Jewel\" and members participated in the development of the perfume from the beginning.

On January 19, 2011, a lawyer representing four of the five Kara members announced to the media that they would be terminating their contract with DSP Entertainment, effective immediately; a lawsuit was also filed on their behalf. Park Gyuri, the leader of the group, was the only one remaining with their management company. In one statement, the lawyer representing the four stated that \"the company repeatedly denied any requests and unilaterally forced tasks upon the members\", and that they have been preparing for legal action for two months. Later that day, it was announced that Goo Hara would discontinue her involvement with the lawsuit and has rejoined the company, as she apparently was not fully aware of the lawsuit's details. In a statement, DSP Entertainment firmly rebutted all accusations, also stating that they wished to resolve the issues and reconcile with the members quickly. DSP also denied earlier reports of denying Kara members their fair share of profits, stating that each member was paid \u20a9 300,000,000 for their work. The lawyer for the three remaining members released another statement giving further details of their allegations. Their representatives stated that they were misinformed regarding their Japanese promotions, and that their relationship with the company severely deteriorated with the hospitalization of CEO Lee Ho-yeon in March 2010. On April 28, 2011, the dispute between DSP Entertainment and Kara's 3 members (Han Seung-yeon, Nicole Jung, Kang Ji-young) was finally resolved. But two years later, in October 2013, DSP released statement that Nicole would not be renewing her contract with DSP Media upon its termination in January 2014. Seungyeon, Gyuri and Hara all renewed their contracts for a further two years, and Jiyoung is taking her time to decide whether or not to study abroad, as her contract doesn't end until April 2014. However, it was confirmed later on by Nicole through her Twitter account that they are still in the midst of discussing and resolving the contract issues as Nicole still wants to work as a member of KARA while managed by a different agency. Alongside Nicole's contract issue, DSP Media however has revealed that \"Because Kang Ji Young contract expires in April next year, she has decided to think over her future.\" An exclusive report from news outlet OSEN however had shed a bit more light regarding her circumstances with the news outlet claiming that Kang Ji Young was leaning towards making a decision to go abroad to study. The report claimed that while she wasn't outright saying that she wanted to leave the group, she had stated that she needed a certain amount of time to rest. On January 14, Jiyoung had officially made her decision to leave Kara once her contract expires in April 2014. Jiyoung's father stated that it will be difficult, but is necessary for Jiyoung so she may leave DSP to pursue her dreams. On February 2, 2012, DSP Media refuted accusations that the man who followed Kara during their time in Japan was a Chongryon-affiliated North Korean agent but was actually their schedule manager.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girls%27_Generation", "name": "Girls' Generation", "labels": ["SM", "EMI Japan", "Interscope"], "intro": " Girls' Generation ( Korean : \uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 ; RR : Sonyeo Sidae ), also known as SNSD , is a South Korean girl group formed by SM Entertainment . The group is composed of eight members: Taeyeon , Sunny , Tiffany , Hyoyeon , Yuri , Sooyoung , Yoona , and Seohyun . Originally a nine-piece group, Jessica departed from the group in September 2014. One of the prominent figures of the Korean Wave , the group has earned numerous accolades and the honorific nickname \"The Nation's Girl Group\" in their home country. Girls' Generation debuted in August 2007 with their eponymous Korean album and the single \" Into the New World \". The group rose to fame in 2009 with the single \" Gee \", which claimed the top spot on KBS 's Music Bank for a record-breaking nine consecutive weeks and was Melon 's most popular song of the 2000s decade. Girls' Generation consolidated their popularity in South Korea with follow-up singles \" Genie \", \" Oh! \", and \" Run Devil Run \", which were released between mid-2009 and early 2010. Their second Korean studio album, Oh! (2010), won the Golden Disc award for Album of the Year, making the group the only female act to win the grand prize so far. The group ventured into the Japanese music scene in 2011 with their eponymous Japanese album , which became the first album by a non-Japanese girl group to be certified million by the RIAJ . The group's third Korean studio album, The Boys , was the best-selling album of 2011 in South Korea. An English version of the single \" The Boys \" was released in an attempt to expand the group's endeavor to the global music scene. The group's fourth Korean studio album, I Got a Boy (2013), was supported by the title track , which won Video of the Year at the inaugural YouTube Music Awards . Girls' Generation released their fifth Korean studio album, Lion Heart in 2015, followed by Holiday Night in 2017. The group's signature musical styles are characterized as electropop and bubblegum pop , though their sounds have varied widely, incorporating various genres including hip hop , R&B , and EDM . In 2017, Billboard honoured Girls' Generation as the \"Top K-pop Girl Group of the Past Decade\". They are the first Asian girl group to achieve five music videos with over 100 million views on YouTube with \"Gee\", \"I Got a Boy\", \"The Boys\", \" Mr. Taxi \", and \"Oh!\". In Japan, they became the first non-Japanese girl group to have three number-one albums on the Oricon Albums Chart with their eponymous album, Love & Peace , and The Best , and their three Japanese concert tours attracted a record-breaking 550,000 spectators. The group's Korean name is So-nyuh Shi-dae ( Korean : \uc18c\ub140\uc2dc\ub300 , RR : Sonyeo Sidae ), from the Sino-Korean root meaning \"Generation of Girls\"; they are also known as SoShi (Korean: \uc18c\uc2dc ) or SNSD , both of which are abbreviated forms of the group's Korean-language name. Because their name consists of Chinese roots, the group's name is similar in Chinese and Japanese: in Japan the group's name is pronounced as Sh\u014djo Jidai (Japanese: \u5c11\u5973\u6642\u4ee3), and in Mandarin Chinese as Sh\u00e0on\u01da Sh\u00edd\u00e0i (Chinese: \u5c11\u5973\u6642\u4ee3/\u5c11\u5973\u65f6\u4ee3). Prior to the group's debut, some of the members were already involved in the entertainment industry. Yoona had gone through about 200 auditions for music videos, dramas, and movies before becoming a singer for Girls' Generation. Sooyoung was exposed to the Japanese music scene as a member of a pop duo named Route \u03b8, which disbanded one year after its debut in 2002. The first member of the group to join SM Entertainment 's training system was Jessica in 2000, after she and her sister, Krystal Jung , were scouted in a mall in South Korea during a family vacation. That same year, members Sooyoung and Hyoyeon were cast into S.M.'s training system through the 2000 S.M. Open Audition, in which Hyoyeon danced for her audition. Yuri was the next Girls' Generation member to become an S.M. trainee after coming second in the 2001 S.M. Youth Best Dancer competition. Yoona was cast the following year through the 2002 S.M. Saturday Open Casting Audition, where she sang and danced to her favorite singers, BoA and Britney Spears . Seohyun , the group's youngest member, was scouted in the subway by an S.M. scout; she then auditioned in 2003, singing children's songs. The group's leader, Taeyeon , was cast in 2004 after winning first place in the S.M. Youth Singing Competition. That same year, member Tiffany auditioned at S.M.'s Starlight Casting System in Los Angeles, and joined the company in October 2004. The final member of the group to be added was Sunny , who had become an S.M. trainee in 1998 and trained for five years before moving to another company, Starworld.

Since 2016, Hyoyeon has also released several solo singles both under her given name and her DJ Hyo moniker. On December 2018, Sooyoung released \"Winter Breath\", her first solo single since departing from SM Entertainment. Girls' Generation's music is predominantly bubblegum pop and electropop . The group's early singles such as \"Gee\", \"Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)\" (2009), and \"Oh!\" (2010) are described as \"cutesy\" bubblegum pop; \"Gee\" also features elements of techno and hip hop , as noted by Abigail Covington from The A.V. Club . Nevertheless, the group's musical styles have varied widely ever since; Anzhe Zhang from the New York University wrote that despite the fact that Girls' Generation's styles are deemed \"mainstream\" in South Korea, the group \"has grown sonically more experimental.\" Their 2011 single \"The Boys\" departs for a more \"mature\" style from the group's previous emphasis on \"cutesy\" themes; it incorporates elements from hip hop, a genre that Girls' Generation had never ventured into. The titular studio album, according to AllMusic 's reviewer Tim Sendra, includes uptempo dance tracks \"with a straight pop radio feel.\" Girls' Generation's 2012 single \"Dancing Queen\"\u2014a remake of British singer Duffy's \"Mercy\" (2008)\u2014features a \" funky pop \" production, as opposed to the group's signature electropop sound. Their 2013 single \"I Got a Boy\" was noted for its eclectic musical style, utilizing various genres ranging from bubblegum pop, electropop and drum and bass to pop-rap , EDM , and dubstep . Jeff Benjamin from Billboard lauded the song as \"one of the most-forward thinking lead pop singles heard in any country.\" Both aforementioned singles' parent album, I Got a Boy (2013), combines elements from a wide range of genres such as 1980s new wave , EDM, and classic and contemporary R&B . Girls' Generation's 2014 EP, Mr.Mr. , features \"exciting\" R&B sounds with \"cool, simple\" melodies. AllMusic's Heather Phares also noted inspirations of EDM, hip hop, traditional K-pop sound, and late-1980s europop on the EP, which she labelled \"a set of songs that offers something for every kind of Girls' Generation and expands their musical reach.\" The group's 2015 album Lion Heart brings back their signature bubblegum pop sound; its third single \"You Think\", however, is a hip hop song that incorporates trap beats in its instrumentation. Although most Girls' Generation's releases are written by songwriters for S.M. Entertainment, some members occasionally participated in songwriting. Member Yuri wrote the lyrics for \"Mistake\" from their 2010 EP Hoot . Sooyoung penned the lyrics to \"How Great Is Your Love\" on the group's 2011 studio album The Boys . Members Sooyoung, Yuri, and Seohyun wrote the lyrics for \"Baby Maybe\" and \"XYZ\" on the group's 2013 studio album I Got a Boy . The group's main lyrical themes as characterized by Chris True from AllMusic are \"dance party\" and \"girls night out.\" Girls' Generation's songs have been criticized by Western media outlets for not portraying female empowerment but promoting the opposite. Ceejay Lee from feminist magazine Fem criticized the \"generic\" themes of Korean girl groups like Wonder Girls or Girls' Generation as \"sexist\": \"[They] infantilize themselves to emasculate males by pandering childlike, puritanical innocence [...] It only reinforces that females are weak beings that serve to gratify males and that males need to be 'man' enough to 'protect' them.\" Stephen Epstein from the Victoria University of Wellington and James Turnbull from Dongseo University expressed concern that the lyrics of K-pop girl groups may raise considerable questions about the empowering nature of \"Girl Group Fever\"\u2014particularly with singles \"Gee\" and \"Oh!\" Writing for The Harvard Crimson , Soyoung Kim wrote that \"the representation of females in K-pop has been problematic\" and singled out Girls' Generation's \"Gee\" as an embodiment; its repetitive lyrics \"What should I do?\" ( \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8c? ), \"fool\" ( \ubc14\ubcf4 ), or \"I don't know\" ( \ubab0\ub77c ) suggest that the girls are \"utterly clueless children\" who \"dumb [themselves] down\" just to attract a partner. He further cited the single \"I Got a Boy\" as an epitome of the group's non-empowering lyrics, with lines such as \"I got a boy, he's awesome / I got a boy, he's kind / I got a boy, handsome boy, my heart's been taken away [...] My prince! / When will you rescue me?\" Kim came to the conclusion that \"female K-pop artists orient themselves around men in order to gain attention.\" Despite the criticism, several of Girls' Generation's songs, such as \"Run Devil Run\", \"Hoot\", and \"Bad Girl\" (from their 2011 eponymous Japanese album) are noted for portraying \"confident young women with their own opinion\", which is a departure from their early singles. The group's 2011 single \"The Boys\" was noted for conveying a feminist theme and was compared to Beyonc\u00e9 's 2011 single \" Run the World (Girls) \" for the same \"women-powered\" content; Eun-Young Jun in the book The Korean Wave: Korean Media Go Global (2013) noted its lyrics for depicting \"sexually daring women\" who are confident in their sexuality. Girls' Generation is known for reinventing their fashion styles and stage performances throughout their career. In their early years, the group performed in uniforms; with the debut single \"Into the New World\", they introduced themselves as high school students. In 2009, the group set the \"colorful skinny jeans\" fashion trend with \"Gee\", and later opted for a marine-inspired image on wearing uniforms and shorts that highlighted their legs with \"Tell Me Your Wish (Genie)\". In 2010, the group's image became more diverse: they used a cheerleader concept for \"Oh!\", while the performances of their 2010 single \"Run Devil Run\" was noted for conveying a darker theme, which was billed \"Black SoShi\". Later that year, the group transformed themselves to Bond Girls -inspired singers for the visual of \"Hoot\". In 2011, the group established a \"heroine\" image, with members choosing their own outfits, emphasizing each of the members' own tastes rather than performing in uniforms. For the performances of \"I Got a Boy\" (2013), the members opted for flat shoes instead of their signature high heels in order to perform the choreography correctly. Girls' Generation's visuals for their 2015 singles \"Catch Me If You Can\" and \"You Think\" were noted for intricate choreography moves with a more \"powerful\" and \"sexy\" image. Girls' Generation's image has often been regarded as \"innocent\", and their performances onstage are described as \"youthful\" and \"colorful;\" Ceejay Lee from Fem commented that Girls' Generation's outfits often reveal legs rather than \"cleavages or derri\u00e8res.\" Eun-Young Jung in the book The Korean Wave opined that the group's concepts fall into two main categories\u2014\"innocent, cutesy, happy\" (early singles \"Gee\", \"Genie\", \"Oh!\") and \"more mature, yet not overly sexy, feminine\" (later singles \"Run Devil Run\" and \"Hoot\"). A writer for the Korean Culture and Information Service deemed the group's image as \"sexy\" and \"girly\" \"goddesses that are hard to approach.\" John Seabrook from The New Yorker described Girls' Generation as \"a group of preppy-looking young women in skinny trousers. When they wear hot pants, it's to display the gams, not the glutes.\" New York Magazine stated: \"according to label executives and fans, [Girls' Generation's] appeal is not their music, which is catchy but derivative. Instead, the [group projects] a humility that gives their fans the illusion that 'when you see them on stage it's like they've come to see you.' \" Taylor Glasby from Dazed remarked that not only the group's early \"pure\" image and music were appealing, but the members' personalities as a whole \"uniquely solidified the GG experience into an intimate family affair,\" noting that their supporters look up to all the members as \"sisters, role models and icons.\" Discussing the public's scrutiny on the group's physical image, member Tiffany remarked: Girls' Generation has been regarded as a prominent figure in South Korean culture and the Korean Wave . In South Korea, they are credited as the lead female group that shifted the public's focus back to female idols after the Korean music industry experienced an influx of male idol groups from 2002 to 2007. CNN noted the group as a \"national phenomenon\" in South Korea and labelled them the \"Asian version\" of British girl group Spice Girls , and Tyler Br\u00fbl\u00e9 writing for the Financial Times selected the group as the one of the ten most recognizable features of South Korea, the only musical act to make the list. Japanese magazine Nikkei Business suggested the group's international expansion and success was the musical equivalent to Samsung 's global trend. Their immense popularity in South Korea has earned the group the titles \"The Nation's Singers\" ( \uad6d\ubbfc\uac00\uc218 ; Gukmin gasu ) and \"The Nation's Girl Group\" ( \uad6d\ubbfc\uac78\uadf8\ub8f9 ; gukmin geolgeurup ). Their success has influenced various K-pop girl groups of the new generation, including GFriend , Melody Day , and Apink . A fixture on South Korean power rankings, the group placed within the top ten of Forbes Korea Power Celebrity from 2010 to 2016, topping the list three times (2011, 2012, 2014). Girls' Generation consistently ranked in the top five of Gallup Korea 's \"Artist of the Year\" poll from 2007 to 2016, topping the list three times (2009, 2010, 2011). The Sisa Journal named the group as the most influential entertainers of 2011 and 2012, while Asia Today ( ko ) included the group in their list of 50 Korean Power Leaders in 2011. The group was named one of South Korea's \"super brands\" by the Korean Institute for Industrial Policy Studies in 2011, and one of the five South Korean musical acts that best represented K-pop during the past two decades by the Korea Creative Content Agency in 2015. [note 2] Girls' Generation is also the first Korean celebrity to have official postage stamps distributed by the Korea Post. The group's 2009 single \"Gee\" was declared \"Song of the Decade\" by Melon and regarded as one of the first K-Pop songs to gain international attention, according to Google Statistics. Ian Martin of The Japan Times noted that the group's popularity was still strong even after the Korean Wave appeal had died down in Japan in 2011\u201312. During 2009\u20132011, the group generated \u20a9 68.8 billion ( $ 62 million), raking in $20 million in profits and becoming the highest profit earner for their label SM Entertainment. By 2012, Girls' Generation had sold over 30 million digital singles and 4.4 million albums, making them one of the best-selling artists in South Korea. Their songs have been widely recognized as the signature songs of K-pop: Pitchfork included \"I Got a Boy\" and \"Gee\" in their list of 20 essential K-pop songs, crediting them as the \"magnum opera\" of modern Korean music. Spin labelled \"Run Devil Run\" and \"Gee\" the 11th and 5th greatest K-pop songs, respectively, while WatchMojo.com ranked \"Gee\" second on their list of Top 10 Iconic K-Pop Songs. Billboard placed \"I Got a Boy\" at number 21 on their list of the 100 Greatest Girl Group Songs, describing it as \"proof to why girl-group music is in a league of its own in terms of excitement and boundary pushing.\" Girls' Generation became the first girl group to achieve four music videos with over 100 million views on YouTube in 2015, with \"Gee\", \"I Got a Boy\", \"The Boys\", and \"Mr. Taxi\", and the first Asian girl group to amass five such videos with the addition of \"Oh!\" in 2016. Billboard Boxscore reported that Girls' Generation was the top touring K-pop girl group by 2016. Five of their concert tours ranked among the ten highest-grossing tours by a girl group as of 2016: Love & Peace (2014; $31.6 million), Girls' Generation's Phantasia (2015; $22.3 million), Girls & Peace: 2nd Japan Tour (2013; $21.5 million), The First Japan Arena Tour (2011; $14.98 million), and Girls & Peace World Tour (2013; $14.97 million). The group won two Digital Daesangs (2009 and 2011) and one Disk Daesang (2010) at the Golden Disk Awards , making them the first girl group to win a Grand Prize three times in a row in the award's history and the only girl group to have won a Disk Daesang so far. They also won two Daesangs at the Seoul Music Awards , and were crowned both Artist of the Year and Best Female Group at the 2011 Mnet Asian Music Awards . The Guinness World Records recognized Girls' Generation in its 2018 edition as the artist that earned the most awards at the Melon Music Awards (13 in total). Girls' Generation are regarded as one of the most sought-out advertisers in South Korea. Marketers named the group as the models with the most influence over consumers, attributing the group's positive attention from the public to their vocals, looks, and fashion sense. In 2009, the popularity of \"Gee\" helped the group generate \u20a91.5 billion ($1.2 million) in endorsement revenue. In 2011 and 2012, the members of Girls' Generation combined were the South Korean celebrities who shot the most number of commercials. The group has appeared in over forty endorsement deals\u2014major ones included LG , Intel , Korean chicken chain Goobne Chicken, Casio , Samantha Thavasa , Domino's Pizza and Lotte . They also collaborated with Korean shopping mall 10 Corso Como Seoul to create their own perfume brand \"Girl\". "}

Island made their debut in Japan on June 8, 2008 with the extended play Prologue of F.T. Island: Soyogi . The band started getting recognition in the country following the release of their third Japanese studio album, Five Treasure Island , in 2011, which topped the Oricon Albums Chart and spawned the single \"Flower Rock\". Additionally, F.T. Island is the first foreign male band and the first band in 42 years to top the Oricon Daily Charts. F.T. Island's most well-known songs include \"After Love\", \"Bad Woman\", \"I Hope\", \"Hello Hello\", \" Severely \", \"I Wish\", and the chart-toppers \"Love Sick\", \"Thunder\", \"Until You Come Back\", and \"Love Love Love\".

Island's first album, Cheerful Sensibility , was released on June 7, 2007. Prior to that, the members appeared on the Korean television show \"Wanna be my girlfriend?\" ( Korean : \ub450\uadfc\ub450\uadfc \uc5ec\uce5c\ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 ) on Mnet .

The album combined 13 songs that were loosely divided into two parts, \" Emotional Chapter \" and \" F.T. Island Chapter \", according to the genre of the songs. The \"Emotional Chapter\" consists of rock ballads, while the \"F.T. Island Chapter\" consists of a variety of pop rock sons produced by Japanese composers who worked with the Japanese band SMAP . Selling over 79,000 copies in 2007, it was the sixth best-selling album of the year. The album was later re-packaged on December 3, 2007, titled The Refreshment (Vol. 1.5) with three extra songs, a photo book, a stack of photo cards and a mixing program called Music 2.0, which allows one to adjust the levels of the instruments and vocals. The edition sold 25,724 copies in December 2007. After debuting in Korea, FNC Entertainment (formerly FNC Music ) moved F.T. Island's activities overseas. On March 31, 2008, an autograph session in Malaysia at the Damansara Cineleisure was held, which was to be followed by the group's first concert at the Sunway Lagoon Amphitheater the next day.

After a year of delay, Made was released in December 2016. Two singles were announced for the release: \" Fxxk It \" (Korean: \uc5d0\ub77c \ubaa8\ub974\uaca0\ub2e4; Revised Romanization: Era Moreugedda ), and \" Last Dance \". The two songs, along with \" Girlfriend \", took the three top places on the Gaon Digital Chart, selling over one million digital copies combined in five days. The same songs peaked at number 2, 3 and 4 on the Billboard World Digital Songs chart, selling 13,000 copies combined. The digital version of Made sold over 1 million digital copies on QQ Music , Kugou , and Kuwo, China's three major music platforms in a day. The album debuted at No. 172 on the United States Billboard 200 with 6,000 equivalent album units, 4,000 of which were in traditional album sales, earning the band their second entry on the chart. They also debuted at no. 1 on the World Albums chart and the Heatseekers Albums chart. In their home country, South Korea, the physical version of the album topped the Gaon Albums chart . Two final concerts were held at Gocheok Sky Dome in January 2017 to wrap up their 10th anniversary tour and Made 's promotional activities. As per South Korea's mandatory military service requirement , T.O.P. enlisted for his two-year service on February 9, 2017 as a conscripted policeman. The remaining members continued promotions without him, holding their fifth annual Japanese dome tour, the Last Dance Tour , in November with 14 concerts in four cities with an attendance of 696,000 fans. The two final shows of the tour were also held at Gocheok Sky Dome in Seoul on December 30 and 31. In 2017, YG Entertainment released a reality program starring the group named Run, Big Bang Scout! through YouTube Red , which was the service's first original content to be produced in a country outside of the United States. The first episode of the program was free-released and has gathered over 12.7 million views on YouTube . The following year, the remaining members began their enlistment: G-Dragon on February 27, Taeyang on March 12, and Daesung on March 13, 2018. Seungri was initially announced to enlist on March 25, 2019. The single, \" Flower Road \", was released on March 13, 2018 as a goodbye to their fans. \"Flower Road\" set a record in China, reaching over a million sales in 3 days and 14 hours, the shortest amount of time for a Korean artist. The song also topped Billboard' s World Digital Songs Chart, and the Gaon Digital Chart, where the song recorded the highest digital index of the year thus far. On March 11, 2019, Seungri announced his retirement from the entertainment industry due to scandals surrounding the Burning Sun nightclub , resulting in his departure from Big Bang. On July 6, 2019, T.O.P was the first member to be discharged from the military. He was followed by G-Dragon on October 25, 2019. Taeyang and Daesung were discharged on November 10. On January 3, 2020, it was announced that Big Bang would be performing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival , marking their first performance since 2017. Reports also began to surface that the group did not renew their contracts with YG Entertainment. However, YG later released a statement, saying \u201cIt is difficult to confirm or deny any details at the current time.\u201d On March 10, it was confirmed by YG that all 4 members successfully renewed with YG and were preparing for a comeback. Big Bang have been praised for their individuality and ability to fuse a pop sound with rap, R&B and dance elements. The quintet is known for experimentalism and for a \"dominating style of music that surpasses genre boundaries\". During the early days of their career, Big Bang's music was predominantly hip hop and pop rap , although they incorporated R&B songs into their albums as well. A writer for Yahoo! Japan once compared their early materials to that of American hip-hop artists such as The Black Eyed Peas , stating that their songs included \"catchy vocals, [...] rap and characters\". The song \"Ma Girl\", Taeyang's first solo from the group's first album, was described as \"[s]mooth, sexy and bass-heavy\" and reminiscent of Omarion . Similarly, Seungri's first solo from the same album, \"Next Day\" (Korean: \ub2e4\uc74c\ub0a0, Revised Romanization: Daeum Nal ), was stated to have an \"intense '90s Usher vibes\". Their first EP Always (2007) was a musical departure from their previous efforts, with the group experimenting with electronic dance music and setting it as the new music trend in Korea. From their EP Hot Issue (2007), the \" shibuya-kei -influenced\" \"Fool\" (Korean: \ubc14\ubcf4; Revised Romanization: Babo ) contained a \"heavy dance beat paired with a smooth disco coating.\" \" Day by Day \" from Stand Up (2008) was admired for \"weaving in and out of tempos seamlessly and forcing a sense of anxiety on the listener through the beating undercurrent\" and hailed as an \"experiential masterpiece\". They also collaborated with the Korean rock-band No Brain for the rock song \"Oh My Friend\". Alive (2012) was noted for showcasing the group's voice instead of their usual autotune, being described as having \"a mature kind of intensity\", with \" Blue \" being distinguished for including \"more interesting electronic samples and production techniques\" and \" Bad Boy \" described as having a \"nostalgic\" sentiment, being called a \"perfect pop song\" that \"transcends language\". In addition, their song \" Monster \" was praised for its use of mournful tone vocals in an orchestra sound. The group mixed a variety of electronic music with soft rock for their third album Made (2016). which was described as \"career-exemplifying\". \" Loser \" was cited for \"introduc[ing] a more mature style\" to the group \"without losing the images they had enforced through previous releases\", while \" Bang Bang Bang \" was noted for its modern EDM -inspired sound and \" Bae Bae \" for its \"boundary-pushing elements\" and becoming one of the first artist Korean artist to introduce Trap music to K-Pop. In \" Let's Not Fall in Love \", Big Bang was complimented for being at \"their most tender\", with the song being described as having a \"lush production that evokes a range of emotions\". \" Girlfriend \" was a \"mellow hip-hop throwback to the group's early days\". Members of the band have experimented with other genres for solo projects, thus the group has been described as \"rich in variety\" for their fans. Taeyang's EP Hot was mainly a collection of R&B songs, with the singer stating that this genre was his \"main focus\". Daesung's first digital single, \"Look at Me, GwiSoon\" (Korean: \ub0a0 \ubd10, \uadc0\uc21c , Revised Romanization: Nal Bwa Gwisoon ), was a trot song, which drew criticism due to Big Bang's image as \"hip-hop artists\". For his debut album, Heartbreaker , G-Dragon incorporated a mix of dance , hip-hop, and R&B songs. Justin McCurry from The Guardian said that \"[e]ach of the five members has his own individual look, and their musical range is equally eclectic, covering R&B, hip-hop, house, electro and pop.\" Additionally, they have been described as \"artistic superheroes\" for showing \"versatility and success in whatever they do\" by rivaling companies. Their continued experimentation with a diverse range of musical styles and their distinct personalities have been highlighted as some of the main reasons for their popularity and longevity. The Chosun Ilbo explained their \"strong lead among idol groups\" as a result of the quality of their music, noting that \"whenever Big Bang promotes new songs, they want to introduce something new and tell us new stories.\" Internationally, Big Bang is often referred to as a \"K-pop\" group, a label which they do not appreciate, with G-Dragon commenting that, \"We are Korean, so obviously they call our music K-pop. But we never thought of our music as K-pop. Our music is just our music.\" In addition, T.O.P noted that \"[y]ou don't divide pop music by who's doing it. We don't say, for instance, 'white pop' when white people make music.\" The group is known for maintaining tight control over their career, heavily involving themselves since their debut in the production of their music and songwriting, as opposed to many Korean idol groups. G-Dragon is known as the member that is most heavily involved in the production of the group's materials, having a role in producing almost their entire discography spanning ten years, and credited as the main songwriter for the group's earlier hits such as \" Lies \", \" Last Farewell \", and \" Day by Day \". G-Dragon, T.O.P, and Taeyang also collaboratively wrote \"Last Dance\", with G-Dragon co-producing the song. Recurring themes in their lyrics deal with love and relationships. In \"Bingle Bingle\", a protagonist is pleading to his lover to take the next step in the relationship. In contrast, \"Let's Not Fall in Love\" halts a new relationship from growing, depicting the hesitation the risk of opening up to someone. Big Bang have also covered other topics in their songs. \"Fantastic Baby\" and \"Bang Bang Bang\" are often described as club music due to their lyrical contents, with the former described as having an \"anarchistic\" theme and the latter being labeled as the \"party anthem of 2015\". \"Fxxk It\"'s use of vulgarity was seen as evidence to their growing age. Their song \"Loser\" was an attempt to \"humanize the group\" by discussing their flaws. \"Bae Bae\" was noted for its metaphor about sex. \"Sober\" talks about chasing one's dream, while \"Last Dance\" is an ode to the band's time together. G-Dragon's contributions were praised by The Korea Times , who described him as a \"genius singer-songwriter\". The rapper himself describes Big Bang as \"an idol group not born of talent but through effort.\" A writer for Yahoo! Japan complimented the group for their involvement in their work, stating that \"perhaps by contributing to their own materials, not only do they become in sync with one another, but each person's personality stands out.\" Big Bang has received praise for their stage presence and choreographies during live performances. Early in their career, the quintet was choreographed by Seungri and frequent collaborator Shaun Evaristo . While they once relied heavily on street dancing for their moves, they have made a transition towards other styles of choreography. One of the moves from their debut single \"La La La\", involving the group lifting their shirts to expose their abdomens, quickly gained popularity online and became one of the top searches on the internet. The choreography for \"Last Farewell\", in which the group incorporates the idea of \"jump roping\" as a dance move, also gained attention. The dance for \" Bang Bang Bang \", choreographed by Parris Goebel , was one of the most popular dances in 2015. Their stage fashion is also a highlight: Fuse TV noted that \"their outfits are almost as entertaining as their performances.\" The group first adopted the \"hip-hop\" concept for their debut. The release of Always in 2007 was accompanied by a change in image, with the group leaning towards a more preppy - punk style, including skinny jeans with Converse or high-top sneakers, which became a hit trend in South Korea. Taeyang also traded his cornrows for a faux hawk . Members of the group have also consistently altered their hairstyles and color throughout the years. Seen wearing brands such as Bape , 10 deep, Louis Vuitton , Jeremy Scott, and Phenomenon, Big Bang would also wear custom-printed hoodies for many of their performances and music videos. They were also credited for bringing back \"old school\" fashion into the mainstream, popularizing brands such as Nike and Reebok high-top shoes. Described as the \"most fashionable\" one in the group, G-Dragon was known to sport triangular scarves that were later nicknamed \"Big Bang scarves\" during their promotion of the single \"Lies\". T.O.P also gained a following for wearing sunglasses during performances. Their use of props during performances \u2013 including \"an abundance of pyrotechnics, streamers[,] confetti\", LED lights, fog , as well as digitalized \"fire-breathing dragons and a rotor-spinning helicopter\" \u2013 have been well received by critics. In a review of their world tour, The Muse admired the group for playing every song like it's the last, for their precision delivery and their individual strengths. At the peak of popularity for Psy 's \" Gangnam Style \", The New York Times journalist Jon Caramanica noted how Big Bang's concert in New Jersey was the \"true wild heart of K-pop\" as opposed to Psy, highlighting their brightly colored costumes, choreography, and stage performance. In 2012, they ranked number one in the Philippines 's Top 3 Mall of Asia Arena concerts, and their concert in Lima was named the best in South America for the year. When compared to Western artists such as Justin Bieber and One Direction , Big Bang's performance were noted for having their \"edges [...] crisper, the sound louder, the dancing sharper\". They were ranked second on the New York Times list of best concerts in 2012 for their Alive Tour at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey . In March 2012, Krista Mahr, Time magazine's South Asia correspondent, wrote an article about her first K-Pop concert at the Olympic Gymnastics Arena in Seoul, describing the group as \"K-pop gods\" for their stage presence. Their Made World Tour in 2015 was a critical and commercial success, with the Los Angeles Times calling their Anaheim concert an \"incredibly significant moment for K-Pop\", praising the diversity of their songs and performances, noting how the concert \"escalated the craft of live K-Pop \u2014 which sometimes doesn't live up to the overwhelming enthusiasm of its fans \u2014 into a sleeker and more adventurous kind of arena spectacular.\" Including the group in their list of Best Concerts of the Year for the second time, The New York Times noted how the \"electric, sleek and dizzyingly busy concert by one of South Korea's most vital K-pop acts made even its biggest American counterparts look like rank amateurs.\" Big Bang is YG's most successful artist and was responsible for more than half of YG's albums sold in Korea from 2014 to 2017 before their hiatus due to military enlistment. They were the first Korean mainstream hip hop idols, being credited for the genre spreading throughout Asia as a representative of the Hallyu Wave . The Korea Times have called them \"the icons of Korean pop [music]\", and cited how G-Dragon 's rise to one of the most accomplished songwriters in K-pop \"has inspired many young idol-wannabes to become singer-songwriters.\" Yonhap News Agency stated that the quintet has helped \u201cspread K-pop as a cultural brand spanning the U.S., Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.\" In 2011, BBC declared that \"K-pop bands, including Big Bang, are making their mark around the world\", citing the group's contribution to YG Entertainment's economic growth. After the group won the 2011 MTV Europe Music Award for Best Worldwide Act , Google announced that its subsidiary YouTube would launch its own K-pop channel in recognition of the popularity and success of K-pop. The British daily newspaper The Guardian also published an article discussing the importance of how the win had \"shed light on the rise of Korean music across Europe\". Jacques Peterson from The Sydney Morning Herald credited their success for giving a \u201cidiosyncratic twist\u201d on their genre that breaks the mould of the idol group formula. Suk Park, the president of DramaFever , has hailed them as the vanguard of K-pop. The Michigan Daily have described Big Bang as a rare group that \"both innovates and defines the direction a genre takes\", affirming that the group and its solo acts \"have left a musical imprint that has affected the global music market.\" Mark James Russell, an entertainment journalist based in Seoul, praised the group for defying categorization, stating how \"[o]f all the mainstream acts, they\u2019re doing the most to push boundaries of what is considered K-pop.\" Anna Fifield from The Washington Post claimed that they \"have defined and redefined South Korean pop music. They've defied the idea that so-called K-Pop is inevitably sugarcoated and factory-produced, and that boy bands are all about pretty faces and lip-synching.\" Los Angeles Times praised their constant re-imagination of sound and image, calling Big Bang as \"one of the most inventive, aesthetically visionary acts in its genre.\" In an article published for the quintet's tenth anniversary, Billboard stated that \"no act has enthralled the Korean music world in the past decade quite like Big Bang\" later adding that they have \"shaped the Korean music industry\" and were enabled to \"surpass international boundaries and shirk off the limitations of K-pop's youth-focused industry.\" In recognition of their global popularity, Big Bang is a prominent face of South Korea when it comes to tourism. Their Big Show concerts were promoted by the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism 's Visit Korea Committee from 2010 to 2012, crediting the group's \"big economic impact on the country.\" In 2014, the national postal service of the country, Korea Post , honored them by releasing official postage stamps containning images of the group. In 2016, they were chosen as ambassadors for the country's \"Creative Korea\" tourism campaign. In 2016, Big Bang ranked second on Time magazine's polls for Most Influential People in the World, behind only American politician Bernie Sanders . The same year, Forbes listed the group at number 54 on their annual list of Celebrity 100 , having earned $44 million from June 2015 to June 2016. Becoming the first Korean act to appear on the list, the group had the third highest annual earnings ever for a boy band, behind only One Direction and Backstreet Boys . Big Bang was named one of the most influential artists to impact the Hallyu Wave by The Korea Herald , being among the acts that best represent K-pop, and the \"Top Male Idol Group in the Past 20 Years\" in Dong-a Ilbo 's survey of both the Korean public and music critics. Additionally, they were the highest ranking musicians in JoongAng Ilbo 's \"Most Powerful Figures In Korean Entertainment\" list, placing at number four. In 2017, they became the first Korean artists to be included on Forbes 30 Under 30 list of musicians revolutionizing the modern music industry. Songs released by the group, such as \"Lies\" and \"Fantastic Baby\" are considered some of K-pop's biggests hits and most iconic songs ever. In their list of \"The 21 Greatest K-Pop Songs of All Time\", Spin magazine lists \"Bad Boy\" at number thirteen and the song \" High High \" by the duo GD & TOP at number seven. \"Fantastic Baby\" ranked at number twenty-two in Rolling Stone magazine's \"50 Greatest Boy Band Songs of All Time\" list. Additionally, \"Fantastic Baby\" placed second and \"Love Song\" thirteenth in Stereogum ' s list of \"Best K-pop Videos\". \"Lies\" was also chosen as the \"Song of the Decade\" by Mnet 's M! Countdown in 2014, and voted as the \"Top Male Idol Song in the Past 20 Years\" in Dong-a Ilbo 's survey of both the Korean public and music experts, that also ranked \"Bae Bae\", \"Fantastic Baby\" and \"Day by Day\" at fourth, fifth and sixth, respectively. \"Fantastic Baby\" was listed on 'The 100 Greatest Music Videos of the 2010s' by Billboard siting the song as one of the K-pop world's most impactful videos of all time. \"Bad Boy\", \"Bae Bae\" and \"Fantastic Baby\" was listed at 8th, 40th and 65th, respectively on 'The 100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s' by billboard, praising the group to be one of the first artist to introduce Trap music to K-Pop. Their work, both as a group and soloists, have influenced numerous artists, including BTS , Jill Scott , Pixie Lott , A*M*E , Nelly Furtado , Cho PD , Got7 , Astro , Teen Top , Monsta X , Chang Kiha , SF9 , Victon , Dynamic Duo , Zion T. , Sonamoo , Topp Dogg , Nu'est , Mamamoo 's Hwasa , Block B 's U-Kwon, iKon , Blackpink , S\u01a1n T\u00f9ng M-TP and Grimes . The Chinese boy band OkBang was specifically fashioned after Big Bang and was stated to have \"many similarities to Big Bang in terms of musical style, wardrobe and hairstyles.\" Filipino singer-actress Glaiza de Castro draws inspirations from Big Bang and their stage presence when performing original Pilipino music and acting. Rapper BewhY , the winner of Show Me the Money 5 , revealed he started rapping after listening to Big Bang, while IU started gaining popularity after covering the quintet. Big Bang's influence extends beyond the music industry, shaping major trends in the fashion industry. Dubbed \"Big Bang fashion\", their style has gained a following throughout Asia, and became a cultural phenomenon in South Korea. The clothes that the members donned on stage are often copied and sold at Dongdaemun Market . In 2011, Big Bang collaborated with Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo to create a line of T-shirts which were quick to become sell-out items. Sun-Times called the members \"five of the most daring, dapper dressers in the world\", and praised their style for always being \"bold, innovative and trend-setting\". Their impact on Korea's fashion industry was highlighted in Vogue Korea 's exhibition in Seoul marking 100 years of the country's fashion history. While the quintet have established themselves as fashion icons, being named one of the most stylish boy bands of all time by western media, they have been criticized for appropriating hip-hop culture, specifically their use of clothes, color coordination, and hairstyles. The quintet is known for their multiple hit songs, with the Gaon Chart reporting that music consumers have learned to trust the group's quality, calling them a \"phenomenon\" because their material is \"consumed evenly by a variety of age groups.\" This allowed them to win several Song of the Year awards from numerous award shows, including in the 13th Korean Music Awards , for \"Bae Bae\" and the 30th Golden Disc Awards for \"Loser\". They were crowned Artist of the Year at the 17th Seoul Music Awards in 2008 and at the 7th Melon Music Awards in 2015. The group was the first artist to win more than one Artist of the Year Award from the Mnet Asian Music Awards , having won in 2008, 2012, and 2015. The group won multiple Best New Artist awards during the early days of their career in Japan . They have won three World Music Awards , including Video of the Year for \"Fantastic Baby\". Big Bang became the first and only Korean act to win an award at the MTV Italian Music Awards when they took home the Best Artist from the World award in 2016. The quintet has been honored with the award for Most Influential Group in Asia at the 5th Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards and with a Special Achievement award at the 58th Japan Record Awards . In 2014, the tenth anniversary of the digital music market release in South Korea, Big Bang was revealed to be the second act with the most digital hit songs in history. With the release of the Made singles in 2015, they became the first. Their albums Hot Issue (2007), Stand Up (2008), Remember (2008), Tonight (2011) and Alive (2012) were also cited as some of the most successful digital albums in history. Their breakthrough hit was the 2007 \"Lies\", which would stay on Melon Chart 's Top 100 for over 54 weeks, the first song to spend over 50 weeks on chart, including 22 weeks in the Top 10. Their follow-up single \"Last Farewell\" tied the all-time record for the most weeks spent at number 1 on Melon , topping the chart for 8 consecutive weeks. In 2011, they reached the top of Cyworld 's Hall of Fame, making them the best selling artist of all time on the chart. Their EP Tonight (2011) became the very first K-pop album to reach the Top 10 on US iTunes chart. In 2015, they became the first act to have three songs in the Top 5 of the Gaon Digital Year End Chart , as well as the first act to hold the first and second spots simultaneously in the same year. They also became the first act to top the Gaon Digital Chart for four consecutive months. Their third album Made (2016), was certified Diamond by the Chinese music service QQ Music and became one of the best-selling albums of all time in China . In 2016, \"Lies\" and \"Day by Day\" were revealed to be, respectively, the second and the fifth most downloaded songs in South Korea since 2006. They also became the first Korean act to have nine music videos with over 100 million YouTube hits under their belt. The music video for \"Fantastic Baby\" became the first by a K-pop group to surpass 300 million views on YouTube. Their first world tour set the record for highest ticket sales in Taiwan , while their London shows gathered the largest crowd for a K-Pop concert held in the UK. Their Japan Dome Tour in 2013 became the highest-grossing tour by a foreign act in Japan. Additionally, their Made World Tour , the most attended tour headlined by a Korean act in history, logged several records for the group: the most viewed online K-pop concert in history, the first foreign act to hold a Japanese dome tour for three consecutive years, the only foreign act to hold three concerts in a row at the Shanghai Arena , the first Korean act to hold a two-day concert in Kuala Lumpur, the largest K-pop arena tour in United States history, the first foreign act to sell out three concerts in Hong Kong on two separate occasions, one of the most expensive concerts in Malaysian history, the largest tour in China by any Korean act, and the biggest K-pop concert staged in Canada.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Eyed_Girls", "name": "Brown Eyed Girls", "labels": ["Nega Network", "Mystic"], "intro": " The Brown Eyed Girls (Hangul: \ube0c\ub77c\uc6b4 \uc544\uc774\ub4dc \uac78\uc2a4, Japanese: \u30d6\u30e9\u30a6\u30f3\u30fb\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba), often abbreviated as B.E.G. , BG , or \ube0c\uc544\uac78 (beu-ah-geol), is a South Korean girl group with four members: JeA , Miryo , Narsha , and Gain . They debuted as an R&B/Ballad vocal group with \"Come Closer (\ub2e4\uac00\uc640\uc11c)\" in 2006 and have since performed in a variety of music genres. They rose to popularity in 2008 with \"L.O.V.E\" and their retro-dance number \"How Come,\" and cemented their position in the K-pop world in 2009 with \" Abracadabra \", with its electronica-based genre, pioneering (albeit controversial) concept, along with its iconic and now globally recognized dance entitled 'The Arrogant Dance (\uc2dc\uac74\ubc29\ucda4)'\u2014successfully ingraining themselves into modern popular culture. The group started their venture into the Japanese music market with the release of a Japanese version of their massively successful 3rd Korean album, Sound-G , in late 2010, with full promotions being held throughout early 2011 under Sony Music Japan , where they gained moderate success. They returned to Korea in late 2011, to garner further success and critical acclaim with their 4th album and its title track \"Sixth Sense\". Other than promoting as a group, all of the members have released solo albums. The group's leader, Jea, was the one responsible of the group's creation and was actively involved in the selection of the other members, picking out Miryo, who was known as a capable female rapper from the hip-hop community having previously worked with other fellow rappers, such as Gil Seong-joon from Leessang , and the main female rapper in well-known hip-hop group Honey Family. Narsha was chosen when Jea remembered her as a \"talented singer\" from her high school days, and Ga-in was selected by the three members after she was eliminated from \"Battle Shin Hwa.\" According to Ga-in, she was crying in the bathroom after failing the audition, was found by composer Ahn Jung Hoon, and then was chosen through the audition in Brown Eyed Girls' company. Singer Yoari trained with the group until 2006, when it was decided she would be the lead singer for Sprinkler. The four members held several small size concerts, and considered the names \"Crescendo\" or \"Dark Angel\" before officially debuting as \"Brown Eyed Girls\". After more than 3 years of training in singing and holding several small size concerts, the Brown Eyed Girls released their debut album Your Story in South Korea on March 2, 2006, with the ballad track, \"Come Closer\" as their single. Debuting as a \"faceless group\" they did not appear on any visual media and chose to not even appear in their own music video. The album was well received by critics but did not do as well as expected commercially. The album was later re-released to include \"Hold The Line\" (which samples \" Push The Button \" by British girl band Sugababes and \" Technologic \" by Daft Punk ). This song became a hit, further boosting the band's popularity. \"Hold the Line\" was disclosed across the world because it was included in the list of songs from the game Pump it Up. After a short break, the group went back into the studio to work on their second album Leave Ms. Kim ( \ub5a0\ub098\ub77c \ubbf8\uc2a4\uae40 ), which included their R&B title track \"You Got Me Fooled\" ( \ub108\uc5d0\uac8c \uc18d\uc558\ub2e4 ). Subsequent singles were \"Oasis\" ( \uc624\uc544\uc2dc\uc2a4 ) featuring Lee Jae Hoon and \"It's Mine\" ( \ub0b4\uaebc\uc57c ), a collaboration with fellow group SeeYa . During the break between their debut and second albums, the Brown Eyed Girls released their first digital single entitled \"I Am a Summer\" ( \ub0b4\uac00 \uc5ec\ub984\uc774\ub2e4 ), which was later included in their second LP. The first two albums contained typical R&B ballads which had been very popular in the K-pop scene. However, the commercial success was relatively higher in two singles between the first and second albums. Moreover, the second album containing \"You Got Me Fooled\" ( \ub108\uc5d0\uac8c \uc18d\uc558\ub2e4 ) was released at nearly the same time as Wonder Girls' \"Tell Me\" which received a nationwide success in Korea. Therefore, their second album was once again a commercial disappointment. At the same time, the general K-pop scene was changing from R&B ballads to dance music. In January 2008, Brown Eyed Girls came back with their first mini-album \"With L.O.V.E.\" Their single, \"L.O.V.E,\" was a departure from the B.E.G. sound that people had come to know but it became an instant success and Brown Eyed Girls scored their first No. 1 song and also one of the top hit songs in the first half of 2008. \"Love Action\" was the second single taken from the mini album. With Love also marked the group's second digital album (after \"I Am a Summer\"), though it was released in conventional CD format as well. After the release of their first mini-album, they could achieve the commercial success. \"Love\" was composed by Saint-Binary and Min-Soo Lee. Looking to strengthen their success, Brown Eyed Girls returned again in September and released their second mini-album \"My Style.\" Title song \"How Come\" is a retro-style dance song that has become a popular trend. On July 20, 2009, Brown Eyed Girls released their third full-length album, the double-disc Sound G . Even though \"Candy Man\" was the first song unveiled from the album, the first heavily promoted single was \" Abracadabra ,\" which was composed by Ji-nu and Min-Soo Lee. He composed the first part of \"Abracadabra,\" and tried to compose the refrain part. However, he could not think of a good idea to make the refrain part. Therefore, Min-Soo Lee, who worked with BEG previously, helped and composed the refrain part of \"Abracadabra.\" The release of this album also saw a shift in the image of the group, as the members redefined themselves as independent and mature city girls.

Inspired by the rotational concept of Japan's girl group Morning Musume , Lee said that his new group would also experience line-up changes, with new members replacing selected members every year to keep the group constantly young and all-rounded. This concept was then newly introduced to the K-pop market. For a while the group was rumoured to be called O.V.E.R, the acronym for \"Obey the Voice for Each Rhythm.\" [a] However, before the group settled with their current name, the company simply referred to them as juniors , a representation of the members' young ages when they first became SM trainees.

The subgroups were part of SM Entertainment's strategy to not limit Super Junior's activities while certain members focused on their individual careers. This allowed the group members greater freedom to focus on different elements of their careers, and gave the group opportunities to explore different musical styles and showcase different skills. The goal of the subgroup formations was also to show that Super Junior could accommodate and perform different musical genres. This strategy was later challenged by critics, as it has influenced an overwhelming amount of music groups to create official and unofficial subgroups alike.

Following the subgroups Super Junior-K.R.Y. and Super Junior-T, on October 2, 2007, SM Entertainment announced the birth of another Super Junior sub-unit project that would begin activities in China starting 2008. Zhou Mi and SM Entertainment's new Taiwanese-Canadian trainee Henry Lau, who was also featured in the music video of \"Don't Don\", were also members of the subgroup. The announcement brought in a huge wave of dissatisfaction and opposition from some fans of Super Junior after the announcement of two new members. Thousands of fans from Super Junior's official fanclub E.L.F. silently sat in front of the SM building and held signs that supported the group having thirteen members. After more rumors regarding adding another member to the subgroup, the fans decided to gain a legal representation as part of SM Entertainment's stockholders. As of March 20, 2008, Super Junior fans purchased 58,206 shares of SM Entertainment, holding 0.3% of the company's entire stock. The fans released a statement that they will take every opportunity to prevent SM Entertainment from adding new members and to keep Super Junior as only thirteen. A time-slot dispute occurred between SM Entertainment and MBC when SM insisted to have Kangin stay on SBS' Explorers of the Human Body instead of MBC's Sunday Night Dong-An Club (\ub3d9\uc548\ud074\ub7fd) where Kangin has been a regular host. MBC temporarily banned the rest of Super Junior from appearing in any future performances and shows hosted by MBC. Kangin also lost his MC jobs to T.O.P. of Big Bang for the music show, Show! Music Core and also two more variety shows, which both soon canceled after Kangin left due to low ratings. MBC demanded an apology from SM Entertainment in order for Super Junior to appear on shows hosted by the channel again. However, MBC concluded that Super Junior's ban was never official, but just a decision for shows' producers to decide. On December 21, 2009, Han Geng filed for contract termination with S.M. Entertainment, unhappy with contract length and salary. On December 21, 2010, the Seoul Central District Court ruled in favor of Han Geng. On September 27, 2011, his departure was made official.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-ara", "name": "T-ara", "labels": ["MBK", "EMI Japan"], "intro": " T-ara ( / t i \u02c8 \u0251\u02d0 r \u0259 / ; Korean : \ud2f0\uc544\ub77c ) is a South Korean girl group , formed in 2009 by MBK Entertainment . T-ara's career is marked by hook-heavy dance-pop music, a result of their close partnership with composer Shinsadong Tiger . A broad array of visual concepts have earned the group a \"chameleon-like\" reputation. [b] The group officially debuted in July 2009 with the single \"Lie\", following line-up changes due to creative differences. Their debut studio album Absolute First Album was released in December 2009 and spawned several hit songs including \" TTL (Time to Love) \", \" Bo Peep Bo Peep \", and \"You Drive Me Crazy\". T-ara gained nationwide recognition after releasing \" Roly-Poly \" in 2011, which went on to become the Gaon chart's best-selling single of the year. At the height of K-pop's popularity in Japan, T-ara signed onto management agency J-Rock for $4.7 million\u2014reportedly the highest figure of any Korean girl group expanding into the territory at the time. Both their debut Japanese single and studio album reached number one on the Oricon weekly charts and were subsequently certified Gold. T-ara's late-2011 Korean release Black Eyes spawned three consecutive number ones: \"Cry Cry\", \"We Were in Love\" and \" Lovey-Dovey \". In 2012, T-ara experienced a dip in popularity as the group faced accusations of internal discord, resulting in Hwayoung 's immediate departure with Areum following a year after. T-ara's later material was released to varying degrees of success before the group began focusing on promotional activities in China, where they attracted attention for their cover of Chopstick Brothers' \" Little Apple \" in 2014. T-ara is regarded as one of the most popular K-pop girl groups in China. T-ara's final release as six members was tentatively scheduled for May 2017, ahead of Soyeon and Boram 's expiring contracts; however, conflicts with their management delayed What's My Name? until June 2017, effectively without their involvement. Qri , Eunjung , Hyomin and Jiyeon had previously extended their terms with MBK Entertainment until December 31, 2017. The original pre-debut five T-ara members (Jiae, Jiwon, Eunjung , Hyomin and Jiyeon ) trained together for three years under Mnet Media . The meaning behind the group's name, which is based on the word \" tiara \", comes from the idea that they will become the \"queens of the music industry\". In April 2009, they released their first song \"Joheun Saram (Ver. 1)\" (\uc88b\uc740 \uc0ac\ub78c, \"Good Person\") for the Cinderella Man soundtrack. Jiyeon teamed up with labelmates SeeYa and Davichi for a collaboration single titled \"Yeoseong Shidae\" (\uc5ec\uc131\uc2dc\ub300, \"Women's Generation\"), which was released in May 2009. In June 2009, Mnet Media announced that Jiae and Jiwon would be leaving T-ara due to differences in music style. The first new member to be added to the group was Boram , the daughter of singer Jeon Young-rok and actress Lee Mi-young. Soyeon , a former trainee of SM Entertainment who was supposed to be the leader of Girls' Generation , and Qri were added to T-ara three weeks prior to debut. In early July 2009, the group was moved from Mnet Media to its subsidiary company Core Contents Media. T-ara made their debut on MBC 's Radio Star talk show on July 29, 2009. Their first performance was on Mnet 's M Countdown music show on July 30, where they performed \" Geojitmal \" (\uac70\uc9d3\ub9d0, \"Lies\") and \"Norabollae?\" (\ub180\uc544\ubcfc\ub798?, \"Wanna Play?\") from their debut single. Their debut was looked upon negatively by webpostings, where people stated that it was lipsynched and commented that it seemed like an \"elementary school\" performance. The group announced afterwards that future performances would be live. In September 2009, Eunjung, Soyeon, Hyomin and Jiyeon collaborated with labelmates Kwangsu, Jihyuk, and Geonil of Supernova for the single \" TTL (Time to Love) \". It was released on September 15, 2009, and became both groups' first number one song as it topped many of the online charts. T-ara and Supernova collaborated again for \" TTL Listen 2 \", a sequel to \"TTL (Time to Love)\", which was released on October 9, 2009, and included all the members from both groups. T-ara released their debut studio album, Absolute First Album , on November 27, 2009. In order to determine the album's title track, Core Contents Media held a survey in which the public had to choose between \" Bo Peep Bo Peep \" or \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" (\ucc98\uc74c\ucc98\ub7fc, \"Like the First Time\"). 9,000 people took the survey on various music portals with 53% (4,770 people) choosing \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" over \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\". However, the latter was promoted on music shows instead for unknown reasons. \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" peaked at number four on the Gaon chart, while \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" peaked at number ten. They held their comeback performance on Music Bank on December 4, 2009. At the 24th Golden Disk Awards , T-ara was awarded Rookie of the Year along with girl group 4minute . The group won their first-ever music show award with \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" on the New Year's Day episode of Music Bank . The song went on to win five awards in total: two on Music Bank and three on Inkigayo , earning them a \"Triple Crown\". Later in January 2010, the group announced promotions for their follow up single, \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\", which ended quickly as Soyeon was diagnosed with H1N1 . The same month, T-ara made a cameo appearance on the seventh and eight episodes of God of Study , in which Jiyeon played a main role. In February 2010, the group announced a re-release of their debut album under the title Breaking Heart . The two lead singles, \"Neo Ttaemune Michyeo\" (\ub108 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uccd0; \"I Go Crazy Because of You\") and \"Naega Neomu Apa\" (\ub0b4\uac00 \ub108\ubb34 \uc544\ud30c, \"I'm Really Hurt\"), were digitally released on February 23, 2010, and peaked at number one and number thirty-one on the Gaon chart, respectively.\nT-ara held their comeback performance on the same day on M Countdown , and won several music awards for \"Neo Ttaemune Michyeo\" over the course of their promotions: two consecutive Mutizen wins on Inkigayo and one first place award on M Countdown .

After promotions for \"Neo Ttaemune Michyeo\" ended, T-ara performed \"Naega Neomu Apa\" on music shows until early April 2010. In June 2010, the group donated all the proceeds of the World Cup merchandise sold on their online clothing shop T-ara Dot Com to a charity for African children. On July 16, 2010 T-ARA representatives announced the addition of Hwayoung Ryu as the seventh member of the group. The reason given was that with so many solo projects, they would be able to have a more complete lineup for T-ARA when individual members were filming or doing other appearances. They also stated that it would allow the members to undertake more solo activities, and would give them all some relief from their heavy schedules. In November 2010, the group was in the third season of the reality show Hello Baby , in which they took care of Moon Mason and his two brothers. T-ara released the digital download for \" Wae Ireoni \" (\uc65c \uc774\ub7ec\ub2c8, \"Why Are You Being Like This\"), the lead single for their first extended play, Temptastic , on November 23, 2010. Temptastic was released in digital format on December 1, 2010, along with their second single, \" Yayaya \". The album's physical release was delayed until December 3 due to the bombardment of Yeonpyeong earlier in November 2010. T-ara held their first comeback performance through Music Bank on December 3 and began promotions with their new seventh member, Hwayoung , and new leader, Boram, and received two consecutive wins for \"Wae Ireoni\" and \"Yayaya\" on M Countdown .

The title track, \"Roly-Poly in Copacabana\", is a eurodance remix of \"Roly-Poly\", named after the song \" Copacabana \" which was popularized in the 80's in Jongno disco clubs. The album peaked at number three, while the single peaked at number forty and forty-five on the Gaon and Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 charts. The group began follow up promotions for the remixed single on Music Bank . T-ara released their debut Japanese single \" Bo Peep Bo Peep \" on September 28, which peaked at number one on the Oricon weekly singles chart with over 49.7 thousand copies sold, making them the first non-Japanese girl group to rank at number one for a debut single in Oricon history.

T-ara and Davichi released their Christmastide ballad, \"Uri Saranghaetjanha\" (\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc0ac\ub791\ud588\uc796\uc544, \"We Were in Love\") on December 23, 2011; which was later included on T-ara's Funky Town re-release album. The single reached number one on the Gaon Chart and peaked at number two on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 .

On July 25 and 26, T-ara held a concert in Japan, with Hwayoung only performing one song due to a leg injury. After the concert, one member of T-ara tweeted a general message about determination, and four of the other members agreed with her. Subsequently, Hwayoung and her sister, Hyoyoung, tweeted about a \"bad person,\" which gave Korean netizens the impression that there was a conflict within the group. Netizens retweeted the messages and speculated that Hwayoung was being bullied. When the bullying controversy got out of hand, Core Contents Media abruptly announced Hwayoung's immediate departure on July 30, after being with the group for one year and eight months. CCM's CEO, Kim Kwang-soo, claimed that Hwayoung's contract was terminated because staff members felt her behavior was hurting teamwork, and the bullying controversy was not the reason for her departure. The controversy caused the group to temporarily suspend activities, while the members continued with their individual activities. Both Hwayoung and the other members of T-ara have said that facts about their bullying issue were made-up by netizens, but on the other hand confirmed there was in fact a conflict between Hwayoung and the other members.

On March 5, Hyoseong's lawyer revealed that she had filed a civil lawsuit against TS Entertainment in September 2017 to confirm that her contract with the agency is no longer valid. Hyoseong's lawyer stated \u201cFirst, there are payments that Jun Hyo-seong has not received. TS Entertainment also transferred the management rights conferred by its exclusive contract with the singer to another party without the consent of Jun Hyoseong herself. Not only is this a clear violation of her contract, but it is also a source of instability in her promotions as a singer.\u201d He also stated that it would be unlikely of Hyoseong to remain a member of Secret while under TS Entertainment given the situation and the lack of trust and communication between the agency and Hyoseong, effectively ending the group. Retro is the main musical style of the majority of Secret's singles, although the group has channeled other genres such as pop , dance , R&B , and hip-hop . Secret were originally formed with an intention to be an RnB and Hip-Hop group as seen in their debut single, \" I Want You Back \". As Seoulbeats wrote, \"Originally debuting with an urban RnB concept, the girls of Secret have transformed themselves into the queens of retro ever since their breakthrough hits with \u201cMagic\u201d and \u201cMadonna\u201d. Furthermore, with Wonder Girls recently vacating their long-held affair with retro in favor of a more fresh and futuristic(?) approach, Secret lays claim as the next best group to have established a retro identity.\" Catherine Deen of Yahoo! Philippines said that the group is known \"for its unique ability to take retro music and make it their own.\" While reviewing \"Love is Move\", Park Hyunmin of enewsWorld commented that Secret is \"known for its pop-heavy beats and easy-to-follow dance moves\". Hyunmin further added that \"Secret's main appeal is its retro beat and sexy choreography\". Secret's output, particularly with their work with Kang Ji-won and Kim Ki-bum, makes use of live instruments such as brass , saxophones and drums with the incorporation of synthesizers and electric guitars . While reviewing \" Poison \", Seoulbeats commented that \"the composition [of \"Poison\"] contains a very fitting saxophone hook along with recognizable brass and drum instrumentals that have become the trademark of Secret and their in-house composers, Kang Ji-won and Kim Ki-bum, who have produced all of Secret's retro hits. Secret's secret formula for success lies not only in their determined execution of one particular style, but their consistent development of a concept that suits them very well.\" Seoulbeats concludes that \"Secret has carved out its conceptual niche in the K-pop market by developing a distinct and consistent style, and thus they are now in a position to elevate their success and recognition in the industry. While most other groups undergo drastic changes over time to keep current fans interested and to attract new fans, Secret clearly benefits from the advantages of continuity. What other groups or idols have carved out a stylistic niche over the years?\" Secret is also known for their transitions to cute and the girl-next-door image through songs like \"Shy Boy\" and \"Starlight Moonlight\" from the sexy and powerful image through \"Magic\", \"Madonna\" and \"Poison\" while still retaining retro as the main theme for their sound. Although a commercial success with \"Magic\" and \"Madonna\" peaking at number two and number one respectively on the Gaon Charts, Secret failed to win a first place award on any televised South Korean weekly music shows such as M! Countdown , Music Bank and Inkigayo until \"Shy Boy\". Seoulbeats wrote, \"Secret embarked on an aegyo phase in their following release of \u201cShy Boy\" although with much voiced displeasure from the members. Despite the radical change in their personalities, their style remained consistent in staying with and expanding upon their retro identity. The song became a major success as Secret traded in their sex appeal for a heavy dose of aegyo, resulting in much hardware for their chart-topping song.\" Secret kept its cute imagery with their following single \"Starlight Moonlight\" until the release of \"Love is Move\" and \"Poison\". During their promotions with \"Poison\", Jun Hyoseong commented \"Secret has always been known as a cute group that appeals to the general public. This time, however, we\u2032ve escaped that and showed off our unique charms. Our visuals have also changed for the sexy.\" Jun added, \"We\u2032re actually closer to Shy Boy in real life.\" The group's popularity and success in Korea has led to endorsement deals such as Gueoseu Chicken, Googims mall, Grand Mer(Online Fising Game), Nike, Nene Chicken, Good Day Soju and Parkga among others.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_(South_Korean_band)", "name": "Highlight (band)", "labels": ["Around US", "Cube", "Universal"], "intro": " Highlight ( Korean : \ud558\uc774\ub77c\uc774\ud2b8 ) is a South Korean boy band formerly known as Beast ( Korean : \ube44\uc2a4\ud2b8). The band consists of four members: Yoon Doo-joon , Yang Yo-seob , Lee Gi-kwang , and Son Dong-woon . Original member Jang Hyun-seung officially left the group in April 2016, and Yong Jun-hyung left in March 2019. In late 2016, the group moved labels from Cube Entertainment to Around Us Entertainment and subsequently changed their name to Highlight in 2017. As Beast, the group released three Korean full-length albums , nine Korean mini-albums , two Japanese full-length albums, and numerous singles . The group debuted in 2009 with the mini-album, Beast Is the B2ST . In 2011, they released their first full-length album, Fiction and Fact , and made their Japanese debut with the single, \" Shock\" (Japanese Version) . As Highlight, the group debuted in 2017 with the mini-album, Can You Feel It? . Beast initially received attention for the lack of industry success previously experienced by its members, with media outlets referring to them as \"a group of recycled material.\" However, the group has achieved significant commercial success and critical accolades and is one of the most awarded groups of all time at the Golden Disk Awards , the Seoul Music Awards , and the Melon Music Awards . Prior to their debut, Korean news outlets reported that Cube Entertainment would be releasing a new boy group known as \"B2ST\", an abbreviation for \"Boys to Search for Top\" pronounced as \"Beast\". The name was changed to \"Beast\" before their debut, but the group retains the original stylisation in all their promotional material. In October 2009, Beast held their debut showcase at the MTV GongGae Hall and made their live performance debut on KBS Music Bank with their debut single, \"Bad Girl\". A documentary recording the story of the group's debut titled \"MTV B2ST\" was filmed during this time, showing the members as they filmed their first music video and bonded with each other. Their debut mini-album, Beast is the B2ST featured five songs, including the intro track \"Beast is the B2ST,\" \"Mystery,\" and \"Oasis.\" The song \"Yet\" ( \uc544\uc9c1\uc740 , Ajigeun ) was banned from airplay due to swearing in Jun-hyung's rap. Beast won their first award, Rookie of the Month for December, awarded by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism . In early 2010, Beast promoted their second single, \"Mystery,\" from the mini-album. The members created their own humorous amateur music video for the song, featuring fellow Korean pop singers including members of Girls' Generation and Kara . The mini-album went on to sell 40,000 copies, an unusual feat for a Korean rookie group, with the album's original print run of 20,000 copies selling out in its first month. In January 2010, Beast and their labelmates, girl group 4minute , signed with worldwide album company Universal Music Group for their international promotions and album launches and began their first international promotions in Taiwan with 4minute. The group was awarded the Best Newcomer Award alongside girl groups T-ara and After School at the 19th Seoul Music Awards in February 2010. Beast released their second mini-album Shock of the New Era in March 2010 with the lead single \"Shock.\" The group achieved their first number-one win on Mnet \u2019s M!

Despite never leaving the top 12 during the show's run, and ranking 1st for more weeks than any other contestant, Kaeun placed 14th during the finale of Produce 48 and therefore failed to make it to the final line-up. On October 18, 2018, former member Lizzy revealed that Kaeun is preparing to debut in a new girl group following her success on the show. On May 15, 2019, Lizzy mentioned that After School members gradually went their separate ways.

[note 1] Because of the song's provocative spread leg choreography; music producers demanded that \"Mirror Mirror\" be changed or the group could not perform the song on their shows.

In an interview with Newsen, a Cube Entertainment spokesperson said that the song was \"neither a sexy or charismatic concept, but a cute concept \u2013 a hip hop dance song that goes well with the summer feel.\" Its Korean title \"\ubb3c \uc88b\uc544?\" (romanized: Mul Joha?, lit. \"How's the Water?\"), is a slang phrase that men use to ask if the girls in a club are hot. KBS announced that the lyrics for \"Is It Poppin?\" were unqualified for broadcast because they contained the English word \"ass\". 4Minute planned to remove the word from the video for re-evaluation. Billboard K-Town columnist Jeff Benjamin tweeted whether the Brave Brothers' new thing was to sample old-school-sounding R&B. Benjamin also noted that similarly to \"What's Your Name,\" \"Brave Brothers uses a similar formula for 4minute's new track, but it all feels smoother.\" He explains the track \"uses subdued snares, a twinkling Ellie Goulding \"Lights\"-esque sample and a soft, recurring vocal sample. Despite sounding busy on paper, the song flows nicely together as a sweet little blend of R&B and electro-pop.\" The song peaked at number 9 on the Gaon Digital Chart and number 6 on the Billboard K-Pop Hot 100 , selling 606,713 digital downloads. In September, 4Minute finished its contract with Universal Music Japan, and shut down the group's Japanese official website as well as its fanclub site, 4Nia Japan.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2NE1", "name": "2NE1", "labels": ["YG", "Avex Group", "Warner Music", "Capitol", "School Boy"], "intro": " 2NE1 ( Korean : \ud22c\uc560\ub2c8\uc6d0 , IPA: [t\u02b0u.\u025b.ni.w\u028cn] ) was a South Korean girl group composed of Bom , CL , Dara , and Minzy , formed by YG Entertainment in 2009. After appearing alongside boy band Big Bang in the song \" Lollipop \", a promotional single for LG Electronics , the group rose to fame with the release of their two eponymous extended plays , 2NE1 (2009) and 2NE1 (2011), and two studio albums, To Anyone (2010) and Crush (2014). All peaked at the number one position on the Gaon Album Chart . They also scored nine number one hits on the Gaon Digital Chart , with \" Try to Follow Me \", \" Go Away \", \" Lonely \", \" I Am the Best \", \"Ugly\", \" I Love You \", \" Falling in Love \", \"Missing You\", and \" Come Back Home \". The quartet simultaneously conducted a similarly successful career in Japan, releasing first a Japanese version of their second EP, Nolza (2011) and following up with the studio albums Collection (2012) and Crush (2014). Following a long-term hiatus, Minzy departed the group in April 2016, while the rest of the group disbanded later that November. Their final single \"Good Bye\" was released on January 21, 2017. At the peak of their career and prior to their split, 2NE1 was considered one of the most successful and popular girl groups in South Korea. Having sold 66.5 million records, they are one of the best selling girl groups of all time . Billboard magazine ranked 2NE1 as one of the best K-pop girl groups of the past decade while The New York Times named 2NE1's performance at the Prudential Center in New Jersey as one of the \"Best Concerts of 2012\". 2NE1 was first mentioned by South Korean press in late 2004. Both Spica 's Bohyung and Fiestar 's Linzy were trainees alongside the 2NE1 members. However, they were eliminated before debut. YG Entertainment formally announced in early 2009 that the group would consist of four members and debut sometime in May of that year. The company stated that the group had trained for four years, and that their debut album would contain songs produced by 1TYM 's leader Teddy Park . The group's name was initially announced as \"21\", however, due to the discovery of a singer with the same name, the group was quickly renamed \"2NE1\". The name, pronounced in Korean to approximate English as \"To Anyone\" or ( US ) \"Twenty One\", combines the phrases \"21st century\" and \"New Evolution\". 2NE1's first extended play 2NE1 (2009) was preceded by two singles. The first one, \" Lollipop \", was recorded with label mate Big Bang and released on March 27, 2009 to promote the LG Cyon phone. Though a music video was filmed, \"Lollipop\" was not promoted due to its product advertisement affiliation, which caused issues with the network chart eligibility. The second single, \" Fire \", written and produced by 1TYM 's Teddy Park , was released that May and contained elements of hip-hop and reggae . Its music video had two versions \u2014 a \"space\" version and a \"street\" version. Within the first 24 hours of release, the videos each received over one million views. Both the song \"Fire\" and the group became popular online search terms. The final single, \" I Don't Care \", was released simultaneously alongside their first eponymous EP in July. Promotional activities quickly followed to demonstrate a softer, more feminine image of the group to contrast the edgier image previously portrayed in \"Fire\". \"I Don't Care\" became the most downloaded song of that month, later winning Song of the Year at the Mnet Asian Music Awards . Although group members recorded and released their own solo materials in August, they performed a reggae version of \"I Don't Care\" on Inkigayo in September. Due to the remix's popularity, it was released to digital outlets on September 3 as their next digital single. Buoyed by the success of their singles, sales of 2NE1 totaled 100,000 copies by the end of the year. 2NE1 later performed at the 6th Asia Song Festival , representing Korea alongside three other groups and later winning the Asian Newcomer's award. In 2010, 2NE1 unexpectedly released \" Try to Follow Me \" in February through various digital outlets without any prior announcement or promotion to support the Samsung 's Corby Folder. The song peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart. That summer, 2NE1 traveled to Los Angeles and London to record English songs for an American debut album with The Black Eyed Peas 's member and music producer will.i.am . The group recorded a total of 10 songs in their initial sessions. The quartet's first full-length album, To Anyone (2010), was released on September 9, and debuted at number 7 on the Billboard World Album Chart. Prior to the release of the album, it had already received 120,000 preorders. Containing a total of 12 tracks, four singles were released: the top five hits \" Clap Your Hands \", \" Can't Nobody \", \" It Hurts (Slow) \" and the chart-topping \" Go Away \". A fifth song \"Don't Stop the Music\" was recorded as a \"special gift for Thai fans\" and was also used in conjunction with the group's Yamaha Fiore endorsement. At the 2010 Mnet Asian Music Awards , 2NE1 took home the most accolades: \"Artist of the Year\", \"Best Music Video\" for \"Can't Nobody\", \"Best Female Group\", and \"Album of the Year\" award. On January 19, 2011, \" Can't Nobody (English Version)\" was released on the Japanese digital retailer Recochoku as a ringtone and ringback tone . The following month, an accompanying music video was made available for download through iTunes Japan. Their Japanese debut single \" Go Away \" was released as a ringtone on March 9, and later used as the theme song for the Japanese television program Mezamashi TV . On March 16, the quartet's first Korean EP 2NE1 was made available in Japan; promotional activities were canceled due to the T\u014dhoku Earthquake and tsunami . 2NE1 debuted at #24 on the Oricon charts , selling 3,860 copies in its first week of release. Initial plans for their official Japanese debut on Music Station were postponed to later that year due to the earthquake, though the quartet did participate in the Naver \"Pray for Japan\" campaign alongside many other Korean celebrities to raise funds for earthquake victims. The group returned to South Korea with their second EP 2NE1 (2011), scoring three number one hits: \" Lonely \", \" I Am the Best \", which also won the \"Song of the Year\" award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards , and \"Ugly\" as well as the top three hit \" Hate You \". The album itself was a major success, topping the Gaon Chart and selling over 108,000 copies. Following the end of promotions in August, 2NE1 held their first sold-out solo concert at the Olympic Hall in the Chamsil Olympic Park on August 26, 27 and 28 in Seoul, South Korea before flying back to Japan. Choosing to re-record their second EP 2NE1 (2011) in Japanese, the album was re-issued as Nolza and released that same year, peaking at number one on the Oricon charts and selling over 48,000 copies. Japanese-language editions of \"I Am the Best\", \"Hate You\", \"Go Away\", and \"Lonely\" were released as singles.

That October, MTV Iggy held a global competition, in which 10 bands from all around the world competed in a voting competition for the title of \"Best New Band\". With their song \"I Am the Best\", 2NE1 was crowned winners of the title on November 10, 2011, making this their first US award. 2NE1 performed at Times Square in December to accept the honor. At the end of 2011, 2NE1 was also nominated for the Japan Record Award for \"Best New Artist\", losing to Japanese girl group Fairies . On March 28, 2012, 2NE1 released their first full-length Japanese album Collection along with their second Japanese single \" Scream \". The album includes Japanese remakes of their Korean songs such as \"Love Is Ouch\", \" Fire \", and \" I Don't Care \", and a cover of Madonna 's 1984 hit song \" Like A Virgin \". Multiple editions of the album were released to include a DVD containing the groups Japanese and Korean music videos, according to Oricon 's music website. The album peaked at #5 on the Oricon Daily Chart and went on to sell over 32,000 copies in Japan. Later that year, 2NE1 and label mate Big Bang were invited to perform for the first time at 2012's Springroove festival in Japan alongside some of the top American and Japanese hip hop artists. The previous year, 2NE1 and the subgroup GD & TOP were invited, but due to the Japan tsunami and earthquake tragedy, the festival was cancelled. 2NE1 also collaborated with Japanese hip-hop group M-Flo for the song \"She's So (Outta Control)\", which was featured on the artist's sixth studio album Square One . It was released as the leading track from the album, two weeks before the album's release on February 29. \"She's So (Outta Control)\" reached number 43 on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart. 2NE1 subsequently concluded their Japanese promotions by performing at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards Japan , which took place on June 23 at the Makuhari Messe . They also won the \"Best New Artist Video\" award for their song \"I Am the Best\". A non-album single \" I Love You \" was also released in their home country, topping the chart and becoming their sixth number one single. That December, 2NE1 and Big Bang made MTV Style's list of \"Best Band Style of 2012\". The two YG Entertainment groups are the only Asian artists to make the list of 10, which includes One Direction , The Wanted , Backstreet Boys , Spice Girls , Destiny's Child , Fun and No Doubt . On March 14, 2013, 2NE1 released the English-language single \"Take the World On\", which was a collaboration with American singer will.i.am . The song had previously been used in an Intel Ultrabook commercial On March 21, in an interview with Elle , CL confirmed that the group has not yet planned an album for the United States, but wanted to produce more songs in English. A second collaboration with will.i.am brought forth \"Gettin' Dumb\"; this time including his bandmate apl.de.ap . The song was featured on will.i.am's second album #willpower , which was released on April 23. 2NE1's next singles were not tied to any album, with the chart-topping \" Falling in Love \" and \"Missing You\", becoming their seventh and eighth number one singles. A third, \" Do You Love Me \", was a top three hit. In 2014, the quartet appeared on an episode of The Bachelor in January and later, on the finale for America's Next Top Model where the latter show was filmed in South Korea. The following month, 2NE1 released their second studio album Crush (2014). Two singles were released simultaneously: \" Come Back Home \" and \"Happy\". \"Come Back Home\" peaked at number one on the Gaon Singles Chart, becoming their ninth number one hit. Their third single from the album, \" Gotta Be You \" was subsequently released on May 20 along with a music video. Crush sold 5,000 copies in 4 days in America, peaking at #61 on Billboard 200 and setting a new U.S record for \"Highest Charting and Best Selling Kpop Album\", beating other groups such as Girls' Generation and Big Bang. On June 26, they released the Japanese edition of Crush, which charted at #4 on the Oricon Daily Album Chart.

Crush was the only record by an Asian artist to make it to Fuse TV 's \"40 Best Albums of 2014\" and ranked first in Billboard magazine's list of \"Best Kpop Album of 2014\" as well as eleventh for its year-end World Album chart. Following the suspension of Bom's contract due to her 2014 drug scandal , other members began exploring independent ventures, sending the group effectively into hiatus. Dara re-established her acting career by starring in web dramas such as Dr.Ian and We Broke Up , as well as KBS's Missing You . Minzy opened the Millennium Dance Academy. CL embarked a solo career in the United States with the release of \" Hello Bitches \" from her upcoming EP Lifted . The group's only activity in 2015 was a surprise performance at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards in Hong Kong. After CL's performance of her solo singles \"The Baddest Female\" and \"Hello Bitches\", all members reunited to perform \"Fire\" and \"I Am the Best\". The performance is now the most-viewed MAMA performance by a girl-group. It was applauded and as a result, was listed as one of the best performances of 2015 by Fuse . Despite not having made a comeback, 2NE1 nonetheless was the 16th most reblogged K-pop group on Tumblr for 2015. Additionally, both 2NE1 and CL were given a nod by Spotify in their \"Year in Music\" Twitter Campaign for each achieving over one million listeners, and being played a \"staggering\" 165 years worth when combined. They also won China 's 2016 Korea First Brand Grand Prize award for \"Top 10 Most Anticipated K-Stars of 2016\". After a year of hiatus, YG Entertainment confirmed the departure of Minzy in April 2016, stating that the group will continue as a trio. Later that November, however, YG Entertainment announced the disbandment of the group. CL and Dara remained signed as solo artists, while Bom was released from her contract. A last single, \"Goodbye\", was released in January 2017 as a farewell to their fans, inspired by a letter CL initially wrote to Minzy. The song topped the Billboard World Digital Songs chart. In 2NE1's debut EP 2NE1 (2009), the group was noted to have a distinct, mixed style. While \" Lollipop \" was categorized as for pop , debut single \" Fire \" is predominately influenced by hip hop . \" I Don't Care \", however, was intended as a song with a reggae feel. Their comeback album, To Anyone , was marked by a strong shift into electronic music. \" Go Away \", the most successful promotional single from the album, is classified as dance .

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2PM", "name": "2PM", "labels": ["JYP Entertainment", "Sony Music", "Ariola Japan", "United Asia Management"], "intro": " 2PM ( Korean : \ud22c\ud53c\uc5e0 ) is a South Korean boy band formed by JYP Entertainment . The current members are Jun. K (formerly known as Junsu), Nichkhun , Taecyeon , Wooyoung , Junho and Chansung . Former leader Jaebeom officially left the band in early 2010. The history of 2PM started when Korean musician Park Jin-young formed an eleven-member band known as One Day. Eventually the band was split into 2PM and a similar but independent group known as 2AM . 2PM debuted with the song \"10 Jeom Manjeome 10 Jeom\" ( 10\uc810 \ub9cc\uc810\uc5d0 10\uc810 , lit. \"10 Points Out of 10 Points\"), which showcased their acrobatic dance styles. They achieved their first number 1 single with \"Again & Again\". Both singles featured on their first studio album, 01:59PM , released in 2009. The band went on to release another Korean album, known as Hands Up , in 2011. They made their Japanese debut later that year with Republic of 2PM . After more than a year, the group returned in 2013 with their third studio album Grown . In early September 2014, 2PM returned with their fourth studio album Go Crazy . On 15 June 2015, 2PM made a comeback with their fifth studio album No.5 . After much anticipation 2PM returned on 13 September 2016 with their sixth studio album Gentlemen's Game . Since July 2017, the group has been on an official hiatus. The members of 2PM all auditioned (except Nichkhun , who was scouted) to become part of JYP Entertainment. Some members already had experience in the entertainment industry, including Jun. K , who had won several singing competitions. Ok Taecyeon , Lee Junho and Hwang Chansung had participated in the show SuperStar Survival . Some of the members had previously lived in the U.S., former leader Jaebeom in the Seattle area, Nichkhun in Southern California , while Taecyeon spent seven years in Massachusetts before returning to Korea. Originally, the members of 2PM were part of a larger group known as One Day. A documentary called Hot Blood Men captured the group's training days. In this documentary, former member Jaebeom finished at the top spot and received the most fan votes. It also featured the elimination of three trainees from the group: Lee Swichi, Jeong Jinwoon , and Yoon Doo-joon were all cut. However, Jinwoon replaced Im Daehun upon the latter's withdrawal. By the end of the training process, One Day had been reduced to an eleven-member group. The band was then split into four-member ballad group 2AM and seven-member hip-hop group 2PM. While most Korean boy bands at the time adopted a \"pretty boy\" (Korean: kkonminam ) image, 2PM constructed a tough and macho beast-like image when they made their debut. By emphasizing their masculine images, 2PM created the \"jimseung-dol\" (jimseung means an animal or beast in Korean) phenomenon in 2008. Jaebeom was chosen to serve as the group's leader, as he was the oldest member and also the one where all the members acknowledged as the most talented one. He played key roles in several of the band's early singles and associated music videos. 2PM debuted with their single \" 10 Out of 10 \" ( 10\uc810 \ub9cc\uc810\uc5d0 10\uc810 ) on 4 September 2008. In October 2008, they began to promote \"Only You\", another song from their debut mini album, Hottest Time of the Day . Concurrently, 2PM hosted the third season of Korean variety show Idol Army . In April 2009, the group released their second mini album, 2:00PM Time For Change , which they began promoting that month with the single \"Again and Again\". In May they won their first Mutizen Song award on M!Countdown , followed by two more and a Music Bank award. On 11 June, 2PM began promotions for \"Niga Mipda\" ( \ub2c8\uac00 \ubc09\ub2e4 , lit. I Hate You ) on M!Countdown . In July 2PM achieved first place on the M!Countdown and Music Bank charts for the song \"Niga Mipda\". On 30 July, 2PM won the 'Only One Song' award on M!Countdown . At this time, 2PM also starred in the popular Korean variety show Wild Bunny. Later that year a controversy regarding Jaebeom emerged. On 4 September 2009, articles surfaced on the internet regarding Jaebeom's posts from 2005 on his personal Myspace account, in which he expressed his dislike for Korea while still a trainee for JYP Entertainment . These posts, leaked by a netizen who hacked his Myspace account, were taken out of context and severely misinterpreted by the Korean media. Jaebeom issued an apology regarding this matter. Although some demanded that Jaebeom should be forced out of 2PM, JYP Entertainment CEO Park Jin-young stated on 7 September lent the singer a vote of confidence, suggesting that he would remain in the group. Yet the following day, Jaebeom announced on his official fancafe that he would leave the group and return to the United States for a while to calm the situation. He planned to return to school and improve his understanding of music. At the same time, he apologized to his fellow band members for not being a good leader and older brother for them. He also promised to come back as a better person. Park Jin-young confirmed that 2PM would continue on as a six-member group. Due to the sensitive topic of Jaebeom's departure, 2PM withdrew for several weeks from their appearances on variety shows. Despite the controversy, the group went ahead with release of its first studio album. Known as 01:59PM , the album was released on 10 November 2009. Yet questions about Jaebeom remained. The day after the album's release, Park Jin-young announced that Jaebeom could return to 2PM if he wished to make a comeback, although the singer's return was not imminent. In support of Jaebeom, the six 2PM members decided to equally split their income from their first album with him. The album included tracks voiced by Jaebeom, although his face was excluded from the cover. The group finished re-filming their music video for \" Heartbeat \", the title song, without Jaebeom in October 2009. The group began promotional activities for the album on a variety of music shows, including M.Net O Good Concert , KBS Music Bank , MBC Music Core and SBS Inkigayo in November 2009. A week and a half after the album's release, 2PM performed at and was honored at the M.net Asian Music Awards with awards for Best Male Group and Artist of the Year (the latter being one of the three most prestigious awards at the show). The group paid homage to Jaebeom during their performance of \"Again & Again\". During the performance, a spotlight shone over Jaebeom's usual position in the dance formation, and his vocals played over the speakers without being replaced. In late November 2009, after two weeks of promotional activities for the 1:59PM , 2PM earned their first #1 on a TV music show (KBS Music Bank's \"K-Chart\") since the album's release, with \"Heartbeat\", which went on to take #1 on the K-Chart for three more weeks. In addition, \"Heartbeat\" achieved the \"Mutizen\" song award Triple Crown on SBS Inkigayo by being the #1 song the Inkigayo \"Take 7\" chart for three weeks, the maximum amount of time for which a nominated song is eligible to win. On 30 December 2009, at Korean Broadcasting System (KBS)'s end of the year Music Festival, \"Again & Again\" was recognized as \"Song of the Year\", winning with 57,060 votes. 2PM's second single from 01:59PM was \"Tired of Waiting\". The song was performed live for the first time at the SBS Music Festival in December 2009. 2PM's promotion for the album ended with their SBS Inkigayo performance in January 2010. In February 2010, JYP Entertainment announced that Jaebeom would not return to 2PM, as his contract with the company had been permanently terminated, with the agreement of all 6 members. A combined fan meeting and press conference was held two days later with the six remaining members of 2PM and JYP Entertainment CEO Choi Jungwook in attendance. Various 2PM fansites were shut down immediately after the conference as a protest of Jaebeom's termination. Management announced that although 2PM would move forward with six members, a new leader would not be chosen to replace Jaebeom. In April 2010, the band released Don't Stop Can't Stop , a mini-album consisting of six tracks. The group intended for the release to illustrate a stronger side of themselves than did their previous releases. The group made their television performance comeback on Mnet's music program M! Countdown in April 2010. 2PM served as the opening act for nine Wonder Girls summer shows in the United States in 2010. 2PM also performed at the eighth annual Korea Times Music Festival in Los Angeles, California in May 2010, and at the Dream Concert in Seoul, South Korea in May 2010. In May 2010, 2PM released the song \"What's Your Celebration?\" for the FIFA 2010 World Cup . The song samples K'Naan 's Wavin' Flag . In July 2010, Taecyeon and Wooyoung left their position of MCs at SBS Inkigayo. The next month, Wooyoung also left Winwin to concentrate on 2PM's busy schedule. The 1st concerts took place on 31 July 1 August (in Seoul) & 7, 8 August (in Busan) ( 2AM & Miss A were invited as the guests of the concert). More than 12,000 fans attended 2PM's first concerts in Seoul. 2PM performed all their hit-songs since 2008 plus solo performance from each member. 2PM held two encore concerts in Seoul on 4\u20135 September to celebrate their second anniversary. In October 2010, 2PM released their fourth EP, Still 2:00PM , with the lead single \"I'll Be Back\" staying at number one for two consecutive weeks in the Music Bank . In November 2010, Still 2:00PM debuted unexpectedly on the 13th spot of the Billboard's World Album-Chart though no promotions for the album were made in the United States. 2PM was granted the \"Most Popular Asian Singer\" award at the Mandarin Music Honors 2010 in China. The group attended the event on 18 October at Wukesong Arena; it was the tenth annual MMH. Previously, Rain, Jang Nara, and Shin Seung Hoon have each taken home the \"Year\u2019s Best Korean Singer\" award, but this is the first time a Korean artist has won the \"Most Popular Asian Singer\" award. 2PM performed \"Heartbeat\" and \"I\u2019ll Be Back\". 2PM officially made their Japanese debut in December 2010 with their first live event in Japan at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Gymnasium, a place well known for sumo games. The platinum showcase was called \"2PM 1st Contact in JAPAN\" LIVE. In May 2011, 2PM released their Japanese debut-single, \"Take Off.\" The song was featured as an ending song in the Blue Exorcist anime series. 2PM\u2019s first Japanese concert tour, known as the \"2PM 1st Japan Tour 2011 Take Off,\" began in Sapporo on 6 May and ended a week later in Tokyo. In June 2011, JYP Entertainment released the track list of their upcoming second studio album, which would be known as \"Hands Up.\" The album was released later that month on 20 June 2011. For the first time, the album featured two songs composed by 2PM members: \"HOT\" by Minjun and \"Give it to Me\" by Junho. The promotion period for the album was short; it ended just one month after the album's release. This allowed the band to prepare for their Japanese promotions and for their \"Hands Up Asia Tour.\" The 2PM Show began broadcasting in July 2011 on SBS\u2019s E!TV cable channel and featured all six members. It was the first time 2PM would emcee a program with their name on it. On 30 November 2011, 2PM released their first studio album in Japanese language, Republic of 2PM . It contains all of their Japanese singles released to date (Take Off, I'm Your Man and Ultra Lover) plus the Japanese version of their most recent Korean hit song \"Hands Up\", as well as a new song composed by Minjun for Japanese fans called \"Hanarete Itemo\" (\u96e2\u308c\u3066\u3044\u3066\u3082, Even When We're Apart) and 4 other completely new songs.

Authorities stated after the fire had been handled that the fire was relatively small and had been controlled by the time the fire team arrived, and apparently started when a spark from some fireworks which were being used in the music video landed on a sponge. All the members and staff present at the time were confirmed to be unharmed.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Junior-M", "name": "Super Junior-M", "labels": ["SM Entertainment", "Label SJ", "Avex Taiwan"], "intro": "Super Junior-M (stylized as SJ-M ), an initialism for Super Junior-Mandarin , is a Chinese sub-unit of the South Korean boy band Super Junior . The sub-unit is the first international music group in the Chinese music industry to have members of both Chinese and Korean descent. Formed in 2008 by South Korea's S.M. Entertainment , Super Junior-M became the third and most successful subgroup branched off from the Korean band Super Junior . The sub-unit originally consisted of leader Han Geng , Donghae , Siwon , Ryeowook , Kyuhyun and two additional members appearing exclusively to the subgroup, Zhou Mi and Henry . In December 2009, Han Geng filed a lawsuit against S.M. Entertainment and decided to leave the main group and sub-unit, resulting in the sub-unit's temporary disbandment. After a year-long hiatus, Super Junior-M returned with addition Super Junior members Eunhyuk and Sungmin . They released Super Junior-M's second mini album Perfection in February 2011. After Han Geng's leave, the group considers Sungmin as the new \"leader\", as he is the oldest member of the team. However, S.M. Entertainment has not released any statements about electing a new group leader. On April 30, 2018, Label SJ released a statement announcing Henry's departure from the group, leaving Zhoumi as the only Chinese member. Before the official name of the subgroup was released, they were known by \"Super Junior China\". On April 3, 2008, SM Entertainment announced their official name to be Super Junior-M, with \"M\" representing the word \" Mandarin \". The \"M\" can also represent a list of other aspects, such as the first letter of their debut album Me , and also \" m\u00ed \" ( Chinese : \u8ff7 ), the pinyin for \"charismatic\" and \"fan\", the latter meaning referring to their desire to connect closer with fans. In October 2007, SM Entertainment announced that a new Super Junior subgroup would debut in China in 2008. Super Junior's original member Han Geng , and a new member Henry Lau , who performed the violin solo of Super Junior's \" Don't Don \", were announced to be the first two of seven members representing the subgroup. Some of Super Junior's official fanclub, E.L.F, signed online petitions and held protests to express their dissatisfaction and opposition of adding a fourteenth member to the group, fearing that a new member would mean one of the original lineup would get 'replaced'. Many fans boycotted Super Junior's products and held silent protests in front of SM Entertainment's main building in Seoul , holding signs of the \"Only 13\" slogan. Over one thousand fans appeared in front of the SM Entertainment building on E.L.F's third protest on November 3, 2007. Instead of a silent protest, the fans sang various Super Junior songs and shouted \"thirteen.\" Fans purchased 58,206 stocks of SM Entertainment, holding 0.3% of the company's entire stock. They released a statement through the media, stating that they would obtain all chances to prevent SM Entertainment from adding new members and to keep Super Junior as only thirteen. SM Entertainment later announced that they would not add the new subgroup members to the main group. From April 4 to April 7, 2008 the seven members of Super Junior-M were individually announced to the Chinese media in a chain of short trailer clips. The first member, Han Geng, was announced to be the subgroup leader on April 4. On April 5, Siwon and Donghae were revealed to be the second and third members. On April 6, Kyuhyun was announced to be the fourth Super Junior-M member, following the new member, Henry, as the fifth. Ryeowook and another new member, Zhou Mi , were announced to be the final two members on April 7. A trailer of all seven members was released on the group's debut day, April 8. Super Junior-M's trailer clips exceeded 1.4\u00a0million views in less than four days. Super Junior-M debuted in Beijing on April 8, 2008 at the 8th Annual Music Chart Awards, simultaneously with the release of their first music video, \" U \" on Sohu.com . \" U \" is a translated Chinese cover of the 2006 song \" U \", originally by Super Junior . They released their debut album Me in selected provinces of China starting April 23, 2008. A Korean version of the album with three bonus Korean-language tracks was released in South Korea on April 30, 2008. A modified version of the album was released in Hong Kong , Singapore , and Taiwan on May 2, 2008. Though a majority of the tracks in the album were Mandarin remakes of Super Junior's previous Korean hits, reviews were generally positive. Hong Kong Cantopop singer, Hins Cheung , critiqued the album favorably, saying that the album contains \"international-level music\" and that the group is \"vocally-talented\". A month after their debut, Super Junior-M won their first award, Asia's Most Popular New Group, at the 5th annual Music King Awards in Macau on May 25. They took home another three awards that year. On December 27 and 28, Super Junior-M held their first concert, the Super Junior-M Show, in Hong Kong .

They appeared in an episode of the second season of TVB and HunanTV 's collaboration show, Strictly Come Dancing , which made the show's ratings increase to 5.01%, ranking it the third most watched show ever in all of China. Super Junior-M's appearance in the talk show Behind Story ( Chinese : \u80cc\u5f8c\u7684\u6545\u4e8b ) also increased ratings. The show had the highest ratings during their time slot, with a strong 4.05%. Separated into several weekly episodes, the group's appearance in their first episode on the challenging game show Bravely Going Forward ( Chinese : \u52c7\u5f80\u76f4\u524d ) in early August gave the show the highest ratings during that time slot as well. In August 2008, Han was cast in the idol television drama Stage of Youth , a mini-drama dedicated to the 2008 Beijing Olympics . Han portrayed Xia Lei, a youth who aspires to be a famous dancer.

Their style has created a fashion trend amongst students which the media dubbed the \"Shinee Trend\". The group's \"boyish charm\" was an important factor in Shinee gaining fans. With the release of 2009, Year of Us , Shinee's style became more mature, though still maintaining Shinee's unique image. Furthermore, instead of working with famous artists and photographers, SM Entertainment's Visual and Art Directing department usually works with up-and-coming talents with new ideas for Shinee's concepts. When Shinee debuted in 2008 with \"Replay\", it was not only their music which gained attention but also their colorful style\u2014but even four years later, in 2012, Shinee maintained their colorful concept for Sherlock . Their designer, Ha Sang-beg, stated in an interview with the Korean Times: \"Much has evolved over the years, since I change their styles to reflect their music. The feel from their debut single still exists, mixing the overground [ sic ] with the underground, haute couture with street fashion ... but it is very modern, like Shinee.\" Shinee are acknowledged for their innovative approach to music and peerless choreography and are considered as one of the best live vocalists and dancers in Korean pop , known for their good vocal performances and complex choreographies as well as a unique kind of music that is quite different from usual K-pop. At SM Entertainment 's showcase in New York in October 2011, Jon Caramanica of the New York Times summarized them as \"the most ambitious\" of the evening and also complimented the group's strong vocal performance. Furthermore, he stated: \"Their music, especially Replay , Ring Ding Dong and Juliette , felt the riskiest, even if it only slightly tweaked that polyglot Pop formula\". Kim Joo-hyun of Beff Report considers Shinee's greatest strength the dismantling of the boundaries between the role of main vocal and subvocal. He positively emphasised the harmony between the two main vocals, Onew and Jonghyun, saying they sing with an aesthetic of \"contrast\", meaning they can't be separated from each other; on the contrary, they actually suit each other when brought together. He also praised the vocal development of Taemin, the youngest member in the group. Jakob Dorof of the monthly British style magazine Dazed described Shinee with the words \"technicolor visuals\", \"choreography as coordinated as ballet\", and \"wildly adventurous hit songs\", stating they are a group that embodies the harmony of these qualities better than anyone else. Tamar Herman of Paste Magazine described Shinee as one of K-pop's most popular dance groups, \"with cutting edge dance moves that are just as technically creative as the songs they've performed\". Shinee have worked with top choreographers such as Rino Nakasone , who choreographed Shinee's early songs like \"Replay\" and \"Love Like Oxygen\" in 2008, \"Juliette\" in 2009, and the group's hit single \"Lucifer\" in 2010, which was nominated for the Best Dance Performance at the Mnet Asian Music Awards in 2010. Misha Gabriel choreographed the songs \"Amigo\" (2008) and \"Ring Ding Dong\" (2009). Tony Testa worked on Shinee's later hit songs like \"Sherlock\" (2012) and \"Dream Girl\" (2013), which are characterized by a unique and distinctive style, while Ian Eastwood worked on \"View\" (2015) \u2013 breaking away from the group's usual powerful and precise choreography and working instead with a groove style that showcases the teamwork of the group. All three songs were awarded with the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards : in 2012, 2013, and 2015. The predominant musical genre of the group is contemporary R&B . The group's early hits like \"Replay\" and \"Lucifer\" veered toward R&B and dance pop, while singles such as \"Get Down\" and \"Jo Jo\" explored other musical styles such as hip-hop and dance. Shinee's third album is significantly influenced by funk rock , electronic music and rock. Billboard columnist Jeff Benjamin compared Shinee's songs like \"Punch Drunk Love\" and \"Aside\" to the sounds of Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie , while tracks like \"Beautiful\" and \"Runaway\" combine \"unique electronic production elements over sugary boy band harmonies to create year-round pop music\". Shinee as a group is known for their experimental sound and various genres with every new release like the group's fifth extended play, Everybody , whose title song is classified under the complextro genre. Jakob Dorof of Tiny Mix Tapes stated that \" Everybody is proof positive that, even in a culture industry designed to minimize the role of real musicianship, talent will find its way to the top.\" He also remarked that \" Close the Door \" highlights the experimental and versatile nature of Shinee's music which frequently charts into unfamiliar territories. With the release of their fourth Korean album, Odd , Shinee returned to their old sound while experimenting with new genres like deep house . The album featured songs in an array of styles including the two singles the electro-house \"View\" and Rocky Horror-inspired funk track \"Married to the Music.\" Alexis Hodoyan-Gastelum of MTV IGGY praised the title song, \"View\", describing it as a great, laid back summer jam even though \"the song fools us into thinking it's an uptempo ballad before reaching its techno peak at the chorus.\" Jeff Benjamin on the other hand praised \"Odd Eye\", which is written and composed by member Jonghyun. Benjamin states the group's \"return to the R&B side of Shinee with feathery vocals, tight harmonies and member Onew's falsetto howls acting a centerpiece to this grooving opener\" but he also adds, \"despite initially debuting with a R&B sound, Shinee is arguably most exciting when experimenting\". Early in their career, Shinee were endorsers for several brands, such as the cosmetic brand Nana's B and the sports brand Reebok . Later, they endorsed the clothing brand Maypole as well as the popular Korean cosmetic brands Etude House and The Saem. In 2012, Etude House's Lash Pump 3-Step Volume-Cara, a PC-based and mobile micro-site featuring \"doll eyelashes\" main model Sandara Park and Shinee\u2014appearing as puppets\u2014was awarded first place for the Movile Marketing and Product Promotions category at the 9th Web Award Korea . The group was also part of the popular Korean comic The Blade of the Phantom Master and then-new webtoon series ENT . Furthermore, the group endorsed the sports brand Skechers and collaborated with Naver and Skechers for T-shirts and caps designed by the group members. Overall, Shinee are models with influence over consumers, as products featuring the Shinee label can increase the revenue of companies \u2013 \"Shinee's Sparking Water\", a simple carbonated bottled water, which is sold by e-mart , the supermarket chain business of Shinsegae , boasted a combined sales of 67 million won over a one-month period.

Members of Super Junior-T explained that they wanted to change their idol appearance and hope that they would gain different fans from their new trot image.\n"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS501", "name": "SS501", "labels": ["CI", "DSP", "Pony Canyon (Japan)", "Warner Taiwan"], "intro": " SS501 is a South Korean boy band consisting of five members: Kim Hyun-joong , Heo Young-saeng , Kim Kyu-jong , Park Jung-min and Kim Hyung-jun . They debuted in 2005 with the EP Warning , which included their first number one song, \"Never Again\". [ citation needed ] In 2007, SS501 entered the Japanese market with the maxi single Kokoro , which debuted at number five on the Oricon chart . The following year, in 2008, they became the first South Korean artists to win the award for Best New Artist at the Japan Gold Disc Awards . SS501 has released one studio album and seven EPs in Korean, and two studio albums and three EPs in Japanese. The group has been inactive since 2010, however the sub-group Double S 301 , composed of members Heo Young-saeng, Kim Kyu-jong and Kim Hyung-jun, continues to release music. The name of the band is a combination of letters and numbers that have special meaning. The first \u201cS\u201d stands for \"superstar\", the second \u201cS\u201d is an abbreviation for \"singer\", and the combination of 5, 0, and 1 symbolizes \"five members united as one forever\". Before debuting with SS501, most members had experiences in the entertainment world. Kim Hyun-joong was initially about to debut in a five-member group, of which Han Yeon of B2Y (now disbanded) was to be the leader and Kim the youngest member. During 2001 and 2002, while working as a waiter in a family restaurant located at Jamsil-dong , Kim was introduced to a new set up management company CEO. While the group underwent training together, they were asked by their company to debut in China as a Hallyu project group, but they rejected the offer and disbanded. Heo Young-saeng started as a trainee at SM Entertainment for about 2.5 years. He then joined DSP Media , formerly known as DSP Entertainment and trained for three months before debuting as a member of SS501. In relation to SM Entertainment as a trainee, according to his father if he had stayed with SM Entertainment most probably he would have debuted together with Super Junior . Park Jung-min was once a commercial model for condoms. When he was 13, he was scouted by an agency and was accepted by both DSP Media and S.M. Entertainment . At that time, SM Entertainment told him that they were preparing a new group, but that the group consisted of many members, which according to Park was probably Super Junior since he saw them rehearsing too. [ citation needed ] Kim Hyung-jun appeared on Ock Joo-hyun 's music video, \"Catch\" in 2004. He was also the first one to be included in SS501, which means he had the longest training period. In addition, SS501 has had their first variety show before they officially debuted entitled SS501 M!Pick by MNET , documenting their pre-debut days and three months after their debut. SS501 debuted on June 8, 2005 along with their first EP, Kyeonggo ( Korean : \"\uacbd\uace0\" , \" Warning \");. Their second mini album, Snow Prince was released in late 2005, five months after their debut. The group earned popularity right away as they won many rookie awards after their debut. The group was inactive in Korea for most of 2006, although they had their first fan meeting in Japan in April of that year. The reason was due to Heo Young Saeng's throat condition, which required a surgery, thus resulting in a need for time to fully recover. In mid-2006, they held their first successful concert, \"Step Up Concert\" in Osaka , Japan. In late 2006, they returned to Korea in order to promote their first studio album, which was released on November 10 entitled S.T 01 Now . Singles from the album included \"Unlock\" and \"Four Chance\". Alongside promoting the album on various variety and music shows, they also filmed a show on MNet, which was called SS501 SOS . The group (excepting Heo Young Saeng, who was recovering from the surgery) also lent their voices for the 2006 animated movie Pi's Story . Later in 2007, the group debuted in the Japanese market to further spread their activities and challenge themselves outside Korea. The group at this time released their Japanese single Kokoro , alongside multiple versions, including one with all members and five featuring each member individually. The single debuted at the 5th spot on the Oricon chart, and moved to 3rd spot the next day. It was also chosen as an ending theme song for an anime entitled Blue Dragon . SS501 appeared in the Japanese drama Hotelier as a cameo seen in episode seven. Later in September, SS501 released their second single in Japan entitled Distance . Finally in October 24, a month later, a full album was released with their self-titled album, SS501 . SS501 also received the \"Newcomer Award\" by Japan Gold Disc Award in January 2008; this was the first time for Korean artists to receive this award. SS501 returned to Korea with their single Deja Vu , which was released on March 13, 2008. The title track was the first song to be promoted, and they began their comeback on music channel M.Net's M Countdown . After their success with their single \"Deja Vu\", they began to promote their second single, \"A Song Calling for You\". They performed their Goodbye Stage on Music Bank in June 2008, to return to Japanese activities. Their third Japanese single was released on June 18, 2008 entitled Lucky Days .

While both Kim and Park were busy with their schedules, the remaining three members formed 'SS501 Project Group' with Heo Young-saeng as the leader. The 'Project Group' was initially to be named after their fan club 'Triple S', however before the sub-unit group debut it was decided to retain 'SS501' name out of respect to the absent members. They released a project album named U R Man in November 2008, with a high tempo dance track \"U R Man\", which the three remaining SS501 members promoted by themselves, with the exception of some special performances that included all five band members.

(2006) and Mirotic (2008), both winning the Golden Disk Award for Album of the Year . The latter album also contains the pop hit \" Mirotic \", touted by international music critics as a staple song of K-pop . With four chart-topping singles, TVXQ gained widespread media attention in Japan following the release of their fourth Japanese album The Secret Code (2009). However, despite their commercial success, the group plunged into legal turmoil and internal conflict when members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu attempted to split from their Korean agency S.M. Entertainment. Prior to the trio's departure in 2010, TVXQ released their last Japanese album as a quintet, Best Selection 2010 , which became the group's first album to top the Oricon Albums Chart . The album spawned two platinum-selling singles, including the long-running hit \" Share the World \". After a year-long hiatus, TVXQ returned as a duo with remaining members Yunho and Changmin. They released TVXQ's fifth Korean album Keep Your Head Down (2011), topping album charts in most major Asian markets upon release. Their first two Japanese albums as a duo, Tone (2011) and Time (2013), solidified their success in Japan as it forged TVXQ's reputation as one of the top-touring artists in the country. Their eighth Japanese album With (2014) made TVXQ the first and only foreign music act in Japan to have four number-one albums in a row. Selling over 10 million physical records in the first 10 years of their career, TVXQ have become one of Asia's most successful music acts of their generation. They are often referred to as \"Asia's Stars\" and the \"Kings of K-pop\" for their immense success and contributions to the Hallyu . According to the Oricon , TVXQ have the most number-one singles and albums for a foreign artist in Japan, and are also Japan's best-selling foreign artist in CD singles of all time. Their Time Tour , one of the highest-grossing concert tours of 2013, broke attendance records for foreign singers in Japan until 2017, when TVXQ broke that same record with their Begin Again Tour . TVXQ are the first non-Japanese Asian artists to headline a nationwide five-Dome tour and the first foreign artists to headline the Nissan Stadium . Billboard has described the group as \"K-pop royalty\". With the disbandment of H.O.T. in 2001 and Shinhwa 's departure in 2003, producer Lee Soo-man of S.M. Entertainment had to search for another boy band to compete against other popular idol groups in the growing K-pop market. In early 2003, Lee eventually selected five teenage boys from four different S.M. training teams to debut in a vocal dance unit. Xiah Junsu, the first to join the new group, became an S.M. trainee at age eleven and was originally trained to be a solo singer. He was put into an R&B trio with trainees Sungmin and Eunhyuk (both now of Super Junior fame), and the trio made their first appearance on the reality show Survival Audition \u2013 Heejun vs. Kangta, Battle of the Century , a 2002 series that starred former H.O.T. members Kangta and Moon Hee-jun as mentors for prospective singers. U-Know Yunho, who signed with S.M. Entertainment in 2000, was a member of several failed project groups throughout his years as a trainee. In 2001, he was featured as a rapper in Dana 's debut single \"Diamond\" and briefly toured with her. That same year, Hero Jaejoong auditioned for S.M. Entertainment and was subsequently accepted into the agency after going through various auditions. Following trainees Heechul and Kangin , Yunho and Jaejoong joined the project group Four Seasons in 2002, but the quartet disbanded when Yunho and Jaejoong were selected to join Lee's new group in 2003. Heechul and Kangin went on to debut as members of Super Junior two years later. Max Changmin, the youngest at age fifteen, was the fourth to join the new band. Micky Yoochun, who started his training only a few months before the group's official debut in December 2003, was the last member to make the cut. The boys received phone calls from Lee and were told to attend a photo shoot session, which turned out to be a briefing for their upcoming debut. To build group chemistry, the members moved into a small dormitory room arranged by their management. After a few weeks of training and rehearsals, they recorded their first song \"Thanks To\" and performed it at the S.M. New Face Showcase. Yunho was appointed as the group's leader. During their early recording sessions, the group was offered some tentative names to use: SM5, Dream Team, O Jang Yuk Bu ( Korean : \uc624\uc7a5\uc721\ubd80 ; Hanja : \u4e94\u81df\u516d\u8151 ; literally \"The Five Visceras and the Six Entrails\"), Jeon Meok Go (short for Jeonseoleul Meokgo Saneun Gorae; \uc804\uc124\uc744 \uba39\uace0 \uc0ac\ub294 \uace0\ub798 ; literally \"A Whale That Eats Legends\"), and Dong Bang Bul Pae ( \ub3d9\ubc29\ubd88\ud328 ; \u6771\u65b9\u4e0d\u6557 ), the Korean name for the Chinese wuxia character, Invincible East . They decided on Dong Bang Bul Pae, and even obtained permission to use the name from Film Workshop , but the name was later rejected by their management because the Hanja was not aesthetically pleasing. Their name was subsequently finalized to Dong Bang Shin Ki ( \ub3d9\ubc29\uc2e0\uae30 ; \u6771\u65b9\u795e\u8d77 ), which was suggested by Lee's acquaintance. TVXQ made their first public appearance and debut on December 26, 2003 in a BoA and Britney Spears showcase, where they performed their debut single \" Hug \" and an a cappella rendition of \" O Holy Night \" with BoA. The group released the physical single of \"Hug\" on January 14, 2004. The single debuted at number thirty seven on the monthly MIAK chart [fn 1] selling less than 5,000 copies. On February 6, 2004 TVXQ made their official television debut at the Mnet and KM cable music program Music Tank , where they performed \"Hug\" and \"O Holy Night\". The following day, they performed on SBS 's Inkigayo . The sales of \"Hug\" picked up following their television appearances, and on March 28, 2004, TVXQ won their first music show award with \"Hug\" on The Music Trend ( Inkigayo ). \"Hug\" won two more awards in April 2004. By May 2004, \"Hug\" sold 118,114 copies and reached a peak at number four on the MIAK. \"Hug\" stayed charted for ten consecutive month\nOn June 24, 2004, TVXQ released their second single \"The Way U Are\", which entered the MIAK at number two. In July 2004, TVXQ participated in their first SM Town project and collaborated with other label mates to release the SM Town album, 2004 Summer Vacation in SMTown.com . In October 2004, TVXQ released their first full-length studio album Tri-Angle . It was TVXQ's first record to debut at number one, selling a total of 242,580 copies in the first month. According to the MIAK, \"The Way U Are\" and Tri-Angle became two of the top ten best-selling albums of 2004. During the promotions of Tri-Angle , S.M. Entertainment had plans to promote TVXQ in mainland China and Taiwan under the support of its overseas partner, Avex Group . TVXQ members recorded Mandarin versions of their popular singles and released them exclusively on the Taiwan presses of Tri-Angle . Inspired by the success of BoA's Japanese music career, TVXQ signed with Japan's Avex Group in late 2004. In November 2004, they released an English version of \"Hug\" in Japan, but the single failed to gain momentum despite TVXQ's Hallyu success. Re-introduced as Tohoshinki ( \u6771\u65b9\u795e\u8d77 ) for the Japanese market, the members learned Japanese and move to Japan for their first official single. They released their debut Japanese single \" Stay with Me Tonight \" in April 2005 through Avex's record label Rhythm Zone . The single reached to number thirty-seven on the weekly Oricon Singles Chart . Before returning to Korea to prepare for their second Korean album Rising Sun , TVXQ released their second Japanese single \"Somebody to Love\" in July 2005, which peaked at number fourteen. TVXQ's debut in Japan was not as successful as their management had hoped, and the group said their first few months in Japan were \"difficult.\" In August 2005, TVXQ performed for Avex's annual A-Nation summer concert tour, their first musical festival in Japan. Rising Sun was released in South Korea on September 12, 2005 and became the group's first breakthrough album. It debuted at number one on the Korean charts and was the fourth best-selling record of 2005. The album's lead single \"Rising Sun\" was a popular hit, and it eventually became the group's signature piece . TVXQ ended the year with two more releases: their third Japanese single \"My Destiny\" and a Korean maxi single \" Show Me Your Love \", featuring Super Junior. The latter single entered the Korean charts at number one. Rising Sun garnered several popularity awards for the group at the end of the year, including M.net KM Music Video Festival 's Best Popular Music Video award, the ceremony's daesang (\"grand prize\"). In February 2006, TVXQ embarked on their first headlining international concert tour, the Rising Sun Tour . Comprising 6 shows only, the tour started off with four shows in Seoul, South Korea. On July 14, 2006, the tour stopped by Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia , where TVXQ were the first Korean artist to hold a concert in the country. The tour's second and last overseas stop was in Bangkok , Thailand on July 15, 2006. A CD recording of their concert in Korea was released on July 14; the DVD was released six months later in January 2007, and had initial sales of 38,000 units. On March 8, 2006, TVXQ released their fourth Japanese single, \"Asu wa Kuru Kara\" ( \u660e\u65e5\u306f\u6765\u308b\u304b\u3089 ) , which became the seventeenth ending theme for the long-running anime series One Piece . Their debut Japanese album Heart, Mind and Soul was released two weeks later, and it debuted on the Oricon Albums Chart at number twenty-five, selling 18,000 copies. In April 2006, TVXQ released their first double A-side single \"Rising Sun / Heart, Mind and Soul\" as a follow-up from their album. The single peaked at number twenty-two. To support Heart, Mind and Soul and its subsequent releases, TVXQ held their first Japanese tour, the 1st Live Tour 2006: Heart, Mind and Soul, from May to June 2006. The tour consisted of eleven shows that attracted an audience of 14,800. After the tour, TVXQ released two more Japanese singles, \"Begin\" and \"Sky\". The latter debuted at number six on the Oricon, making it the group's first single to reach the top ten in Japan. The group resumed their Korean activities with the release of their third Korean album, \"O\"-Jung.Ban.Hap. on September 29, 2006. The album entered the Korean charts at number one and became the best-selling record of 2006 after one month of release. The success of the album gave TVXQ four coveted grand prize awards in 2006: at the M.net KM Music Festival, they received four awards, including Artist of the Year and Best Group. TVXQ won all three of their nominations at the 16th Seoul Music Awards , and at the 21st Golden Disk Awards , \"O\"-Jung.Ban.Hap won Album of the Year, the ceremony's grand prize. TVXQ also took home the biggest awards at the SBS Gayo Daejeon . The album's international success won the group their first award in Japan, the Bess Buzz Asia in Korea award at the MTV Video Music Awards Japan . In November 2006, TVXQ returned to Japan to release their eighth Japanese single, \"Miss You / 'O'-Sei-Han-G\u014d\" ( miss you / 'O'\u2010\u6b63\u30fb\u53cd\u30fb\u5408 ) , which became TVXQ's first top three single on the Orico'. In January 2007, TVXQ announced their second international tour, the 2nd Asia Tour: O , and toured Seoul, Taipei , Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Shanghai and Beijing . The tour attracted an audience of 390,000. TVXQ released their second Japanese album Five in the Black in March 2007, debuting at number ten on the Oricon with nearly 27,000 copies sold on its first week. Drawing in an audience of 46,600, the group toured Japan from May to June 2007. The five singles TVXQ released upon completion of the tour, including \" Lovin' You \", \" Summer \", \" Shine / Ride On \", \" Forever Love \" and \" Together \", peaked in the Oricon top five, their most successful being \"Summer\", which peaked at number two. TVXQ were also featured in Kumi Koda 's thirty-eighth single \" Last Angel \", which was used as the theme song for the Japanese release of Resident Evil: Extinction . Released in November 2007, the single peaked at number three on the Oricon and won Best Collaboration Video at Japan's MTV Video Music Awards . TVXQ's sixteenth Japanese single \" Purple Line \", released on January 15, 2008, became the group's first single to debut at number one on the Oricon. Their third Japanese album T was released a week later and debuted at number four, selling over 52,000 copies. With the critical and commercial success of T , TVXQ delayed their Korean comeback to put more focus on their new Japanese releases, and from February to March 2008, the group released a series of five singles consecutively for six weeks, promoting the releases as the \"Trick\" project. Each single contained a solo track by a member, as well as some of their own compositions. With their new records the group toured around Japan from March to May 2008. The T tour concluded with 17 shows and attracted an audience of 150,000 people, more than three times the size of their previous Five in the Black tour. The tour's DVD, released in August 2008, sold 112,000 copies. T also received a gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) in May 2008. Shortly before completing the T tour, TVXQ released their twenty-second Japanese single, \" Beautiful You / Sennen Koi Uta \". The latter track, \"Sennen Koi Uta\", was used as the opening theme for the historical Korean drama The Legend when it aired in Japan. Despite the drama's disappointing ratings, the single was a number-one seller, making TVXQ the first non-Japanese Asian performer to release two number-one singles in Japan, a record which was last held by Taiwanese artist Ou-yang Fei-fei twenty-four years prior. In July 2008, TVXQ released their twenty-third single, \" D\u014dshite Kimi o Suki ni Natte Shimattandar\u014d? \", their third number-one single in Japan. They performed the single at Avex's 20th anniversary meeting and at A-Nation 2008, their fourth consecutive concert with Avex. In August 2008, TVXQ returned to Korea to prepare for the release of their fourth Korean album, Mirotic . The group assumed more creative control in this album compared to their last Korean releases: Yunho wrote the rap for several tracks, Junsu and Changmin wrote the lyrics to two tracks and Jaejoong and Yoochun recorded their own solo tracks. Mirotic was slated to be released on September 24, 2008, but due to an unprecedented amount of pre-orders , the release was postponed to September 26. The album entered the charts at number one and sold over 110,000 copies in one week, setting a new record. The album's lead single \" Mirotic \" became TVXQ's most successful single of their career. The song won a total of nine number-one trophies on Korean music programs The Music Trend , Music Bank , and M! Countdown , and was touted by international critics as a staple song of K-pop. Mirotic has sold over 600,000 copies, the first Korean album in six years to surpass half a million sales in South Korea. In October 2008, TVXQ released the Japanese version of \"Mirotic\", which topped the Oricon, breaking a record that the group had set with their previous single. TVXQ were the first Korean group to attend the Japanese New Year Eve's music festival K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen , and their invitation to the event was considered as one of the biggest highlights of their Japanese music career. In January 2009, the group released their twenty-fifth Japanese single \" Bolero / Kiss the Baby Sky / Wasurenaide \", which was another number one single for the group. \"Bolero\" was used as the theme song for the Japanese film Dance Subaru , and TVXQ also made brief cameo appearances in the film. In February 2009, the group kicked off their third international tour, the 3rd Asia Tour: Mirotic, which went through five cities in Asia. TVXQ released their fourth Japanese album The Secret Code in March 2009 and it debuted at number two on the Oricon. It managed to sell over 317,000 copies in Japan, earning a platinum certification. From May to July 2009, TVXQ went on their fourth headlining Japanese tour, the 4th Live Tour 2009: The Secret Code, which consisted of 21 shows to an audience of 279,500 people. The last two shows of the tour were at the Tokyo Dome , making TVXQ the first Korean group to perform at the venue. The concert's DVD, which was released in September 2009, pre-sold 107,000 copies and ultimately sold more than 353,000 copies. A number-one seller, TVXQ were the first foreign artist in twenty years to peak at first place on the Oricon's DVD rankings. In July 2009, members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu attempted to split with their Korean management S.M. Entertainment , claiming that their thirteen-year contract was excessively long, schedules were held out without permission of the members, and profits were unfairly distributed. In October 2009, the Seoul Central District Court granted the trio a temporary contract injunction, and TVXQ's group activities in Korea were ceased. In November 2009, Yunho and Changmin released a joint statement in support of S.M. Entertainment, and urged the trio to resolve their issues with their management quickly if they wished to continue their careers as TVXQ members. As a result of the legal battle, the Shenzhen show for the group's Mirotic tour was canceled a week before its scheduled date on November 21, 2009, thus prematurely ending the tour. Despite the injunction, Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu maintained their activities as TVXQ members under Avex's management in Japan, and the group continued to release new Japanese singles together until early 2010. However, the members' last public performance together was on December 31, 2009, at the 60th NHK K\u014dhaku Uta Gassen , where they performed their twenty-eighth single, \" Stand by U \". In January 2010, TVXQ released their twenty-ninth single, \" Break Out! \", which created a new record for the group. The single topped the Oricon and broke Elton John 's fourteen-year record of having the highest first-week sales for a foreign artist. On February 17, 2010, TVXQ released their Japanese greatest hits album Best Selection 2010 , a compilation of their number-one hits including new singles released after 2009's The Secret Code , such as \" Share the World / We Are! \", \"Stand by U\", and \"Break Out!\". The album sold over 400,000 copies in one week, earning RIAJ's double platinum status by the end of February. In March 2010, the group released their last single together, \" Toki o Tomete \", which was certified platinum by the RIAJ. On April 3, 2010, Avex declared the suspension of TVXQ's Japanese activities, stating that each member would be pursuing a solo career. However, a week later, Avex announced the formation of a \"special unit\" with members Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu\u2014later known as JYJ \u2014a move that led to Yunho and Changmin's indefinite hiatus from music activities. After JYJ's announcement, S.M. Entertainment filed a lawsuit against JYJ to validate their contracts. In June 2010, JYJ submitted a lawsuit against S.M. Entertainment to void their exclusive contracts. Following the suits, S.M. Entertainment attempted to denounce JYJ and their new agency C-JeS, while Yunho and Changmin remained silent throughout the legal proceedings. In the meantime, Avex released two of TVXQ's greatest hits albums, the Complete Single A-side Collection and the Single B-side Collection , both of which were released on June 30. They were TVXQ's closing releases under their contract with Rhythm Zone. After several months of inactivity, Yunho and Changmin made their comeback appearances in August 2010 for the Seoul stop of the SM Town Live '10 World Tour , where they performed re-recorded versions of older TVXQ songs. Their two-piece performances garnered strong and supportive reactions from the audience, prompting Yunho and Changmin's decision to continue TVXQ activities without the other three. There were brief talks about recruiting new members, but their mentor Lee Soo-man suggested that they should continue as a duo act. Shortly after the concert, the duo began working on their comeback album and brought in a new line of producers, including E-Tribe and Outsidaz. In September 2010, Avex dropped JYJ, citing conflict with C-JeS. Avex then declared its support for remaining TVXQ members Yunho and Changmin on November 24, announcing that the duo have signed a new record contract with Rhythm Zone's sister label Avex Trax . Yunho and Changmin released TVXQ's comeback Korean album Keep Your Head Down on January 5, 2011. The album debuted at number one on the Gaon Albums Chart , and maintained its position for a second week. With 230,922 copies sold by mid-2011, Keep Your Head Down won the Album of the Year for the first quarter of 2011 at the Gaon Chart K-Pop Awards . The album's title single, \" Keep Your Head Down \" also stayed strong on the charts, winning seven number-one trophies on music shows The Music Trend , Music Bank , and M! Countdown. The Japanese version \"Keep Your Head Down\", which was released as a physical single in Japan on January 26, 2011, was a chart-topper and became TVXQ's second best-selling single in Japan, earning a platinum certification by the RIAJ. In March 2011, Keep Your Head Down was reissued with a new single, \" Before U Go \", and the repackaged album Before U Go peaked at number nine on the Gaon, pushing the album to be the third best-selling record of 2011 in South Korea. While promoting Keep Your Head Down , Yunho and Changmin spoke up for the first time about their 2010 hiatus and breakup with JYJ. According to Yunho, JYJ had \"exceedingly deep conflicts\" with their agency and the members had irreconcilable differences about their career. Changmin added that the team had worked so hard to the point where they felt like they could finally \"harvest the fruits of [their] labor\", yet instead of being happy they had to perform their final stage with heavy hearts. JYJ responded by saying that they did not regret their decision in leaving S.M. Entertainment. The lyrics of \"Keep Your Head Down\" also came under media scrutiny, with claims that they were directed at JYJ; however, TVXQ clarified that \"Keep Your Head Down\" was not a diss track, and that similar claims would still happen even if they were to release a different song with different lyrics. Yunho said, \"The song is about a man's mind towards a woman who had left him. We can sometimes find out that a certain song seems to talk about my own story. In this way it totally depends on the interpretation using our own thoughts.\" In July 2011, TVXQ released their thirty-second Japanese single \" Superstar \", which was certified gold by month's end. From July to August, the duo toured around Japan for Avex's A-Nation summer concert, and at the Tokyo stop, TVXQ performed as the closing act, breaking Ayumi Hamasaki 's record of closing the concert eight years in a row. TVXQ were the first foreign performers to close the festival. On September 28, the group released the Japanese album Tone , which earned them their first number-one studio album. It sold over 200,000 copies on its first week and earned RIAJ's platinum certification on its second week. TVXQ was the second overseas artist in Japan to achieve album sales of more than 200,000 in a week; the previous holder was Bon Jovi with their 2000 album, Crush . In the latter months of 2011, the duo performed for a string of K-pop music festivals around the world. They first performed at the 2011 Hallyu Dream Concert at Gyeongju Citizens' Stadium in South Korea on October 3. On October 9, TVXQ participated in the New York-Korea Festival , a concert produced by KBS Global to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Korea's entry into the United Nations. It was held in New Jersey. On October 23, TVXQ performed with SM Town at the SM Town Concert in New York at Madison Square Garden concert and garnered international media attention. TVXQ also participated in the 2011 K-pop Music Fest in Sydney, Australia, presented by JK Entertainment on November 12. Their new Japanese holiday single \" Winter \" was released on November 30. The single's A-track, \"Winter Rose\", was selected as the commercial song for Seven & i Holdings's Winter Gift , which premiered on November 8. TVXQ also contributed in their Korean management's December compilation album 2011 Winter SMTown \u2013 The Warmest Gift , and released the song \"Sleigh Ride\". On December 31, TVXQ performed \"Keep Your Head Down\" at the 62nd NHK Kohaku Uta Gassen . It was their first time performing at the Kohaku since the split, drawing media attention. TVXQ started 2012 with their comeback Japanese solo tour, the Tone tour , in January 2012. Tickets were sold out in a few minutes. Spanning a total of twenty-six shows in nine cities, the Tone Tour reached to an audience of 550,000, more than twice the audience count of their 2009 Japanese tour, The Secret Code. TVXQ also became the third foreign artist, after Michael Jackson and the Backstreet Boys , to perform at the Tokyo Dome for three consecutive days, attracting crowds of over 165,000. The Tone tour's 550,000 audience was also the largest mobilization for any Korean artist in Japan at the time, until TVXQ broke their own record with their 2013 Japan tour Time . With the release of their thirty-fourth chart-topping Japanese single, \" STILL \" in March 2012, TVXQ became the first foreign artist to release ten number-one singles in Japan. By July 2012, TVXQ came to be recognized as the first foreign artist in Japan to sell over 3.1 million CD singles, breaking a ten-year, ten-month long record that was previously held by the American vocal duo, The Carpenters . The group had a fan club event tour called \"The Mission\" that attracted over 100,000 fans TVXQ returned to South Korea in September 2012 to release their sixth Korean album Catch Me , followed by the announcement of their first world tour, the Live World Tour: Catch Me .

On November 26, TVXQ released Humanoids , the repackage of Catch Me , which also peaked at number one. Two days after the reissue's release, S.M. Entertainment and JYJ dropped their lawsuits against each other and reached a settlement, ending their three-year legal dispute. As part of the agreement, both parties stated that they would no longer interfere with each other's activities, and it was agreed upon that JYJ's contracts with S.M. Entertainment had ended in July 2009. On January 16, 2013, TVXQ announced on their official Japanese site the release of their sixth Japanese album Time for March 6. The album became their fastest selling studio album to date, selling over 277,000 copies in its first month of release. Its lead single, \" Catch Me -If You Wanna- \", sold over 137,000 copies, and topped the Oricon Weekly Singles Chart, making the group the first foreign artist to have had twelve number ones on Oricon. In March the group took part in the TRF tribute album TRF Tribute Album Best for TRF's 20th anniversary. They sang a cover of \"survival dAnce ~no no cry more~\" and were the only Koreans to participate on the album. TVXQ set several records with their Time tour , which commenced at the Saitama Super Arena in April 2013. The duo became the first K-pop artist and the fourth foreign artist to embark on a five-dome tour, and were the first foreign musical act to perform at the Nissan Stadium as a headlining artist. The tour attracted a record audience of 850,000 people. The tour grossed US$90 million, breaking Tone's record. On December 26\u201327, 2013, TVXQ held two concerts titled Time Slip at the Korea International Exhibition Center in Ilsanseo-gu , South Korea to celebrate their tenth anniversary.

Similar to their 2015 album Rise as God , The Truth of Love was tagged as a \"special\" album release, so it was not regarded as an official studio release.

It was TVXQ's eighth album to debut atop the Oricon Albums Chart , breaking BoA 's record in becoming the first and only foreign artist in Japan to release eight number one albums. TVXQ have labeled their lead singles as \"SMP\", a supposedly experimental genre with a mix of orchestral pop , rock , hip hop , and contemporary R&B , topped with harmonizing vocals and high notes. Many of TVXQ's songs feature lyrics with dark social commentary. TVXQ's musical style has evolved over the years. Dance-pop and contemporary R&B ballads persisted throughout their releases, and they have released a cappella versions of their music. In their first two albums, TVXQ explored rap rock , and have collaborated with the rock band TRAX in those attempts. With their fourth Korean album Mirotic (2008), TVXQ delved into urban contemporary and electropop , and the album's lead single \" Mirotic \", a song marked by heavy-urban dance and Europop sounds, is considered one of the staple songs of K-pop. In the albums after the split, Yunho and Changmin experimented with more electronic dance music , traditional R&B, and pop songs with strong hip hop cadences. However, the duo's tenth anniversary album, Tense (2014), saw a drastic change in TVXQ's musical direction, in which acoustic genres such as adult contemporary pop music took focus. TVXQ's dance choreography has been called \"intense and powerful\". Their stage performances have been described as \"imaginative\" and \"captivating\", with Yunho and Changmin being lauded for their stability and stamina to perform live, with some live concert sets lasting for more than three hours. On an episode of Mnet's Idol Chart Show that aired on May 4, 2011, TVXQ were ranked number one among music removed (MR) idol singers. The five original members of TVXQ made their first appearance as actors in 2005, through the sitcom Rainbow Romance and their own seven-episode miniseries titled Banjun Theatre . In 2006, TVXQ starred in their second miniseries Vacation , also releasing a soundtrack. In 2012, Yunho and Changmin appeared in the biographical movie I AM. , a film that contained interviews from SM Town artists. The duo was featured in another SM Town film, the concert documentary SM Town: The Stage , in August 2015. In April 2016, during the duo's hiatus, they released their own Japanese concert film , Till , in Japan. In May 2018, the duo made cameo appearances on the television special drama Tensai Bakabon , playing as two hotel porters who appear again ten years later as members of a popular band. In November 2008, the Korean Commission of Youth Protection ruled that \" Mirotic \" was detrimental to youths and declared that the lyrics were provocative and overly sexual. As a result, the album was labeled with stickers indicating that it was unsuitable for people under 19 years old and any performances of the song would have to be broadcast after 10\u00a0PM. In response to the ruling, SM Entertainment agreed to make a clean version but also had filed an injunction to overrule the commission's decision. The lyrics were changed from \"I got you\" to \"I chose you\" and \"I got you under my skin\" to \"I got you under my sky.\" In March 2009, the Seoul Administrative Court ruled in favor of SM Entertainment. The Commission of Youth Protection announced they would appeal the ruling to a high court after having an emergency meeting and deeming that the phrase, \"I got you under my skin\", was inappropriate for minors. On July 31, 2009, three of the members\u2014 Hero Jaejoong , Micky Yoochun , and Xiah Junsu \u2014submitted an application to the Seoul Central District Court to determine the validity of their contract with their management agency, S.M. Entertainment . Through their lawyers, the trio stated that the 13-year contract was excessively long, schedules were held out without the confirmation or permission of the members, contract terms had been extended and changed without their knowledge or consent, and that the group's earnings were not fairly distributed to the members. Early termination penalty of their contract would cost them twice the profit that the group was estimated to earn for S.M. Entertainment in the rest of the contract period. The news of their lawsuit was enough to cause S.M. Entertainment's stock price to drop over 10% on the KOSPI . The Seoul Central District Court granted the three members a temporary contract injunction in October 2009 and stated that S.M. Entertainment could not interfere with their individual activities, thus placing a halt on TVXQ's group activities in South Korea. The members claimed that the contract was unfair and that they were left out of proper profit distribution. In response, S.M. Entertainment called a press conference and claimed that the lawsuit was not about unfair contracts or human rights, but motivated by the three members' greed to pursue their cosmetics business uninhibited by the restrictions of their exclusive contract with S.M. Entertainment. The agency submitted a complaint on criminal misdemeanor charges against the cosmetics company CreBeau; however, it was never brought to court by the prosecutor on grounds of insufficient evidence. The three replied that they hoped S.M. Entertainment would respect the court's decision. In response to the lawsuit, 120,000 TVXQ fans filed a petition against S.M. Entertainment's long-term contracts to the Seoul District Court. The Korean chapter of TVXQ's fanclub, Cassiopeia, also filed for compensation from S.M. Entertainment for the cancelled S.M. Town Live Concert, as both S.M. Entertainment and TVXQ initially stated that the concert would go on as planned. The concert was canceled a week before its scheduled date. TVXQ's Mirotic Asia Tour Concert in Shenzhen, which was scheduled to be held on November 21, 2009, was also canceled. Though TVXQ's activities in Korea were ceased, the three continued activities as TVXQ members until the end of the year in Japan, where they were managed by Avex. On April 3, 2010, Avex announced the indefinite suspension of TVXQ's Japanese activities. The three, later known as JYJ , signed a new contract with Avex to form a new special unit, which was announced on April 13, 2010. The trio released their debut Japanese EP, The... in September 2010. On February 17, 2011, the Seoul Central District Court dismissed S.M. Entertainment's injunction against the three, filed in April 2010 for damage compensation. In September 2012, the final decision on the case was postponed indefinitely by the Seoul Central District Court for mediation under the justice department. The lawsuit came to an end on November 28, 2012, with both parties mutually agreeing to withdraw their lawsuits, stating that the three members' contracts came to an end on July 31, 2009 and that both parties would mutually not interfere with each other's activities. An S.M. official was quoted as saying, \"We made a judgment that we don't have to manage the three members of JYJ any longer as they expressed their intention not to keep their activity as TVXQ\" and further added that they have decided to end the litigation \"to avoid bringing additional harm to U-Know Yunho and Max Changmin, who are active as TVXQ, and to avoid making any more unneeded issues\". TVXQ have endorsed products such as LG Mobile , Samsung ' s Anycall , sportswear Fila , and Oronamin C . Some of their songs have even been used as theme songs for television shows, commercials and motion pictures; [fn 2] such as One Piece , Chevrolet and Subaru . In 2011, the newly reformed TVXQ duo landed endorsement deals in Korea with brands such as Nike , The Shilla Duty Free, Pepsi NEX Zero , Missha , and most recently with Lacoste . In Japan, they have endorsed Seven & i Holdings , 7-Eleven products, the Seibu Silver card, 7-net shopping, and Ezaki Glico ice cream products. On August 14, 2012, Missha launched a new limited-edition TVXQ perfume set and had a special TVXQ fan signing event at the Missha store in Myeong-dong . On September 10, 2012, Missha announced that TVXQ had signed an exclusive contract with them to represent the brand worldwide and that their advertisements would soon be featured in some 1,000 stores across Asia. In 2005, the Los Angeles Tourism Corporation launched the \"See My L.A.\" campaign. TVXQ, along with label-mate BoA, became the spokespeople for the campaign. Since April 2007, TVXQ host their own weekly radio program, TVXQ Bigeastation on the Japan FM Network . On March 28, 2008, TVXQ were chosen as the \"Goodwill Ambassador for Asia\" by Universal Studios Japan in order to further promote the attractions of the USJ. TVXQ were also chosen to be the new faces for the Lotte duty-free shop , due to their popularity throughout Asia. The official fanclubs of TVXQ are Cassiopeia in South Korea and Bigeast in Japan. Their fandom color is red. According to news sources in 2008, Cassiopeia was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as \"the world's largest fanclub\" with more than 800,000 official members. However, the Guinness World Records later stated that \"[w]e currently have a category for the largest fanclub for a group, but no record has yet been set and we haven't been provided with any evidence\". TVXQ was also reported to have made it into the Guinness World Records in 2009 for being the Most Photographed Celebrities in the World, which was also directly refuted by Guinness World Records. When Jaejoong, Yoochun, and Junsu started their lawsuit against their management, 120,000 Cassiopeia members filed a petition with the Seoul District Court in 2010 against S.M. Entertainment's long-term contracts. Cassiopeia also filed for compensation from S.M. Entertainment for the canceled SM Town Live Concert, as both SM and TVXQ initially stated that the concert would go on as planned. The concert was canceled a week before its scheduled date. TVXQ are known for breaking numerous sales and attendance records in Japan.

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_the_Max", "name": "MC the Max", "labels": ["Music&NEW", "325 E&C"], "intro": "M.C the MAX (an acronym for Moon Child the MAX ) is a Korean rock band. They debuted in 2000 as a 4-member band under the name Moon Child. Upon one of the members leaving, the remaining three members re-grouped as M.C. the MAX. They were initially managed by the production company of Yoshiki , founding member of the Japanese heavy metal band X Japan . On September 1, 2016, it was reported that M.C the MAX had chosen to form their own music agency, 325 E&C. Their song \"Love Poem (\uc0ac\ub791\uc758 \uc2dc)\", from their 2nd album, topped the KBS chart in February 2004. To date, they have released 8 full-length albums, several singles, and began participating in soundtrack contributions for several Korean television series as well. M.C the MAX originally debuted in May 2000 with the release of their 1st album Delete as a quartet under the name \"Moon Child\": Lee Soo , J. Yoon , Jeon Min-hyuk and Heo Jung-min . Their 1st album consisted of mainly songs in the techno rock as well as the rock ballad genre. They released their 2nd album \uc0ac\ub791\ud558\ub2c8\uae4c (loosely translated to Because of Love ) on May 2001. Their 2nd album had a more similar sound to what they do today, consisting mainly of ballads mixed with a rock sound. Their title song \"\uc0ac\ub791\ud558\ub2c8\uae4c\" is a ballad song with some rock sounds mixed in. It was their last album to feature member Heo Jung-min, as he left the band in late 2001 for personal reasons. Their first two albums was met with limited success and after member Heo Jung-min left the band in 2001, it partially influenced their decision to disband. They then re-grouped as a trio with the remaining members under their current name \"M.C the Max\". The name change and the decision to regroup could be seen as means to release songs with improved quality than ever before, as well as be 'reborn' under a new identity. They released their first album as a trio with a new band name on October 31, 2002. They steered into music of the ballad genre, while keeping their rock sounds. They gained popularity in Japan with the support of Yoshiki from the popular Japanese rock band X Japan , and they also remade \" Tears \" from the band. The newly remake song was included in their first album M.C the Max with the name \" See You Later \". In addition, the second disc which was included with their first album consisted of songs entirely written and composed by the members themselves, which displays the members' musical abilities. Although the band still had the strong \"Moon Child\" image, through the resurgence under a new name, M.C the Max was building an image of a talented band. On December 2003, M.C the Max made their comeback with their second full-length album Love Is Time Sixth Sense . The title track \" Love Poem \" was composed by the frontman of Anzen Chitai , K\u014dji Tamaki . The new album will be released and sold simultaneously with Anzen Chitai's album. The album was met with great success and appealing to many Koreans, as M.C the Max won for the first time since debut on music programs. They won a total of 7 trophies with the title track and 2 triple crowns (winning consecutively for 3 times) on music programs such as the then Music Camp (the current Show! Music Core , and Inkigayo . The following year, they released their third full-length album Solitude Love on November 18, 2003. The title track \" Don't Be Happy \" was composed by a singer-songwriter in Japan, Kohmi Hirose who released the million-selling single Romance no Kamisama . Their 3rd album consisted of several songs of the ballad genre than before. However, a situation where members Jeon Min-hyuk and J. Yoon did not want to enter (preparation) sessions since the release of their second full-length album in 2003 was revealed. M.C the Max members then lost their desire to continue activities, forcing their widening activities to be stopped abruptly. Despite this, M.C the Max won an additional 5 trophies and another triple crown with their title track on more music programs such as M! Countdown . Even though the promotional activities for their third full-length album were stopped abruptly, that did not deter them from releasing a new album in 2005. They made a comeback after a year with their fourth full-length album The Rusted Love on November 23, 2005 and the title track \" \uc0ac\ub791\uc740 \uc544\ud504\ub824\uace0 \ud558\ub294 \uac70\uc8e0 \" (loosely translated to Love Is Going to be Painful ) won another 5 trophies on music programs. The members then expanded their entertainment activity rather than releasing mainstream music. They ventured into contributing soundtracks for dramas and also releasing a compilation album. Most notably, they released the soundtrack \" \uc0ac\ub791\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub124\uc694 \" for the television series Which Star Are You From , and also released the compilation album In Search for Love . At the end of 2006, the members' contracts with Paramount Entertainment expired. As they did not own the band name, Paramount Entertainment tried to debut \" M.C the Max 2 \" and member Lee Soo as a solo singer, independent from the group. Lee Soo had objected to the decision, stating that \"Unless this group consists of the 3 of us, we will not be able to release any music. The M.C in M.C the Max stands for Moon Child, and for the three of us only.\" which was against the policy of Paramount Entertainment. They then left the agency and signed a contract with a new agency named Vitamin Entertainment. However, Paramount Entertainment stated that they possessed the rights to the name M.C the Max until 2014, and had plans to add legal restrictions on the use of the name. After which, they filed a lawsuit for the name rights. Meanwhile, while the lawsuit was ongoing, M.C the Max was planning to release \" \ubcfc\ub54c\uae30 \uc0ac\ub791 \", a song which they had recorded earlier. Later on, they released the song together with the digital single \"The Perfect Ballad\". Lee Soo also released the soundtrack \"\ub098\ub9cc\uc758 \uc2ac\ud514\" which was a remake song original sung by Kim Don-kyu for the musical drama \"\ub3d9\ud654\". In late 2006, the court made a decision in favour of M.C the Max, and Paramount Entertainment had to retract their decision to debut \" M.C the Max 2 \". M.C the Max also claimed ownership for the four full-length albums they've released under the agency up till now. M.C the Max then made a surprise announcement that they will release their fifth full-length album Returns on April 18, 2007. The album consists of songs that goes beyond the different types of ballad and traditional rock sounds. They stated that one of the few factors was to break the perception that M.C the Max was a ballad band. After the release of their fifth full-length album, M.C the Max also planned on releasing another repackaged album to meet their fans twice through album promotions. After the promotional activities for their album has been completed, Lee Soo also worked with the vocalist of Rumble Fish , Choi Jin-yi on the duet \" Requiem \". Together with Choi Jin-yi, they also started working on Lee Soo's solo album \"I Am\" which was to be released on May 2008. Both J. Yoon and Jeon Min-hyuk also participated in the preparation sessions. J. Yoon and Davink was also active in project activities, being part of the electronica project band Monotonik . J. Yoon also collaborated with Shin Hae-chul who had produced their first album under the name Moon Child and their upcoming fifth full-length album to form the project group \" Wittgenstein \". Among news of the members' solo and project activities, rumours that M.C the Max also began to spread. However, M.C the Max had squashed the rumours as they announced they were making their comeback with the release of their sixth full-length album VIA 6 on September 30, 2008 after a year and 5 months. To commemorate the release of their sixth full-length album, M.C the Max also announced that they were going on a national cpncert tour titled Eclipse around Korea.

In 2009, M.C the Max released the live album \" Moonchild Is Invincible \" which contained the songs sung live in the 2007 concert of the same name. On June 13 and 14, M.C the Max members held their final concert titled \" Goodbye for a moment \" at Yonsei University before their military enlistment. A few days later on June 18, during the free time between their final concert and the date of their military enlistment, they released the special album \" Rewind & Remind \" online. The special album will also be made available at music stores on June 23. On June 25, Lee Soo started his military service by enlisting as a public servant and entered the training camp.

As stated by LUV in an interview, LUV stands for \"Love yoUr Voice\", stating that everyone should love themselves and their strengths and flaws in their hearts. They were first featured on JTL 's \"A Better Day\" as the female singers on the song. Shortly thereafter, they debuted with \"Orange Girl\", which was very popular, as it was performed numerous times. They released their second single, \"I Still Believe in You\", with an accompanying music video soon thereafter. Their first album, Story , was released on May 15, 2002. Sometime in August, LUV promoted \"Tears\" from the same album and performed it at a military concert along with groups such as S.E.S. and Fin.K.L. They were credited as having massive potential, and were compared numerous times to S.E.S. Although the band was popular and had a large fanbase, they did not last long, as each member had their own dream. The band quickly split after one year of mild success and pursued personal goals. Jeon Hye-bin released a solo album and pursued an acting career, and her past experiences in the group led to her success as a singer. Oh Yeon-seo pursued an acting career, and Jo Eun-byul has been working as a stage actress in musicals in the playhouse district of Daehangno since LUV disbanded, although she was featured in a performance of JTL 's \"A Better Day\" in 2005. Eun-byul, now known as LeeBie ( \uc774\ube44 ), has released a solo mini-album titled \uc624\ub298 \ud558\ub8e8\ub9cc (This Day) on October 26, 2009. On November 11, 2009, LUV reunited for a showcase, but a reunion is not completely clear. On March 30, 2010, their album, Story was released for purchase on iTunes after eight years.\n"}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leessang", "name": "Leessang", "labels": ["Jungle Entertainment", "Leessang Company"], "intro": "Leessang ( Korean : \ub9ac\uc30d ) was a South Korean hip hop duo, composed of Kang Hee-gun (\"Gary\" or \"Garie\") and Gil Seong-joon (\"Gil\"). Formed in 2002, the duo has released eight albums to date: two self-titled records in 2002 and 2003, Library of Soul in 2005, Black Sun in 2007, Baekajeolhyeon (\ubc31\uc544\uc808\ud604) in 2009, Hexagonal in late 2009, Asura Balbalta in 2011 and Unplugged in 2012. Their last three albums broke numerous records and guided their entry to the mainstream Korean music industry. In 1997, Gary joined X-Teen, a hip hop group, where he met Gil. They released two albums. Gary later said that he had neither the looks nor the talent so they left the group. Gary and Gil then joined Honey Family . They released two successful albums in 1999 and 2000. The other members were Digitty, Miryo , Park Myung Hou, Jura, Young Poon, and Su-Jung. To date, the group is still acknowledged as one of the best hip hop groups of all time because of their unique blend of rapping styles. Gary, Gil, and Diggity collaborated to form a \"Leessam Trio\" ( sam means three in Korean), and released a compilation album called 2000 Korea in the year 2000. Diggity eventually left the group. Gil and Gary changed the name to \"Leessang\". Diggity later stated in an interview that part of the reason he left is because when success went to his head he felt like a celebrity. Gil managed to borrow 2 billion won to fund their first album. With no formal musical training, the duo learned as they were producing by spending 400 hours straight inside the studio. Through their efforts, they managed to produce 60 songs. On June 27, 2002, Leessang released their first album, Leessang of Honey Family . Their breakaway hit was the title track featuring Jung-in . The song, \"Rush\", which uses an identical baseline to \"You Are Everything\" by the Stylistics and was released one day after Nelly's Grammy winning song - \"Dilemma\", won the hip-hop music awards from the Mnet KM Music Video Festival. Many credited the perfect blend of Jung-in, Gil and Gary's voices as one of the reasons for the song's success. This was also the beginning of their long partnership with Jung-in. \"Rush\" remains in Leessang's repertoire to date. [ when? ] They released their second album, Jae,Gyebal (\uc7ac,\uacc4\ubc1c) on May 22, 2003. Jung-in once again provided the female vocals for their second hit song \"Leessang Blues\", written and composed by Gary. When they made their \"best of\" album titled Leessang Special , a workflow was developed that has loosely remained the same. Gary writes most of the lyrics, Gil does the music, and they both produce. Despite their success, they were still largely underground. Gary said in episode 98 of Strong Heart that they were so \"unknown\" that they were blocked by security when they came to receive their first major award. Their mainstream breakthrough happened when they released their third studio album Library of Soul on October 14, 2005. On May 17, 2007, their fourth album Black Sun was released. Leessang said that every song on the album tells a story of their life. They eventually won Cyworld Digital Music Awards: Song of the Month when the song stayed on the charts for 4 straight weeks. It took them two years to release their fifth album, Baekajeolhyeon . The title track, \"Champion\", was dedicated to boxer Yo-Sam Choi , who was very close to Gary and Gil. Choi died on the ring in 2008. Gary decided to direct the music video, which was a move that set the precedent on all their succeeding music videos. In 2009, Leessang signed with a new label Jungle Entertainment , founded by hip-hop legend Tiger J.K. (aka Drunken Tiger). It was later reported that Jungle is one of the few labels that give their artists more artistic control and gives probably the highest percentage in rights and royalties. Leessang and Ryoo Seung-Bum toured to Sydney, Australia for the first time in this year with show producer Leonard Dela Torre. They released their sixth album, Hexagonal on October 6, 2009. The lead single, \"Girl Who Can't Break-Up and Boy Who Can't Leave\" featured Jung-in once more. The song went straight to #1 on KBS Music Bank where it stayed at #1 for three weeks straight. Another song in the album, \"Let's Meet Now\", was a collaboration with the band Jang Gi Hwa and Faces. It was used for Fish & Grill's TV Commercial. Leessang's seventh album, Asura Balbalta , was released August 25, 2011. The title song, \"I Turned Off The TV\", occupied the top position on Billboard's K-Pop Hot 100, and every other song from the album charted. \"I Turned Off The TV\" was banned by all TV networks and radio stations because of explicit sexual content. However, it was reported to earn US$500,000 within the first month of release. Gary later said that they were becoming more comfortable talking about different sensitive issues as they age. In 2011, LeeSsang embarked on their first nationwide solo tour titled Leessang Theatre. [ citation needed ] Gary revealed on Strong Heart (TV series) that the inspiration to his songs \"Leessang Blues\", \"I'm Not Laughing\", \"Ballerino\", \"Girl Who Can't Break up, Boy Who Can't Leave\" and \"You're the Answer to a Guy Like Me\" was his ex-girlfriend of almost 7 years. In May 2012, Leessang released their eighth album, Unplugged . It was a fulfillment of their long time dream to collaborate with different artists from different genres, using a full band via an analogue recording. That same month, the duo announced that they created Leessang Company. They intended to create live events that were geared towards putting up quality and innovative live shows. Jungle Entertainment remains their label but they will produce and direct all their live shows under the new company. On July 15, 2012, Gary and Gil were both featured on Psy 's \"Seventy Seven 101.\" Psy, Kim Jin Pyo, and Leessang all worked together on the song. The song and the album were restricted because of explicit lyrics in \"Seventy Seven 101\". In December 2012, they performed a one-night only show with the band YB with whom they collaborated for the song \"Someday\", \"Run\" and \"Madman\". After strong public demand, they decided to do a short nationwide tour with YB. They also went to their first U.S. Tour. They had a show in New York and Los Angeles, and both were sold out. On July 14, 2015 Leessang reached the top of multiple charts with their single \"Kaleidoscope\" featuring Mi Woo. On April 6, 2017, it was reported that they may have disbanded as they have parted their own ways and work solely, after establishing their own music labels. Leessang has been respected even before their mainstream success despite signing with a fairly non-mainstream label, rather than a well-known large K-pop entertainment company. Leessang are known to write and produce their own songs, direct their music videos, and keeping their private lives separate from their professional work. They are also credited for being one of the few artists to help non-idol singers and musicians get some attention by the mainstream public. They are often regarded as a physically unappealing group, especially in the variety shows they partake in. However, since the success of Hexagonal , Asura Balbalta and Unplugged , they have been known to support themselves despite not receiving media attention based on their attractive looks. Gary is known for his off-tempo rapping while Gil's voice is nationally known for its huskier approach. They are also widely regarded for their live performances. They are known to receive constant favorable reviews for their live performances and are particularly known for showing personal stories of their own upbringing. "}

Although F-iV consists of four members, the group's name is pronounced like the word five in English.

Moreover, the group states that the iV in the group's name is supposed to be like the Roman numerals IV , which is equivalent to the number 4 like the number of members in the group. The four members of F-iV were first formed as a group by their label H&J Entertainment in 1999 due to the rise in popularity of R&B music from groups such as Fly to the Sky and Brown Eyes , and were recruited for their music talents such as composition and arrangement. The group spent three years training in preparation for their eventual debut. On September 25, 2002, F-iV released their debut album F-iV [Faiv] , which featured songs with R&B and ballad elements.

They are known for having combined genres and different styles of hip hop throughout their career, which has seen the release of eleven studio albums since their debut in 2003, as well as for their coverage of diverse lyrical themes. The group went on hiatus between 2010\u20132012 whilst two of the members served mandatory military service . Upon their return, YG Entertainment signed Mithra Jin and DJ Tukutz on July 25, 2012, with Tablo having already released a solo album under the label. They have received international acclaim, winning several music awards in Korea and becoming the second Korean act to play at Coachella . Epik High formed in 2001 upon frontman Tablo's return to South Korea after being educated in Vancouver and Stanford . With the addition of Mithra Jin and DJ Tukutz, the group made their beginnings in the underground hip hop scene in Seoul, performing with other Korean hip hop groups such as CB Mass and as part of the \"Movement Crew\", one of the largest hip hop crews of the time in South Korea. As the genre was unpopular among mainstream audiences, the group was relatively unknown early on in their career, with critics seeing little market for \"lyrically complex music\" that did not match the K-pop model of the time. Their first performance was to a small audience at the amusement park Everland in 2002. They released their debut album, Map of the Human Soul , under Woollim Entertainment in 2003, and began to gain success with the release of their second album, High Society (2004). Swan Songs was intended to be Epik High's final album, following the poor performance of their previous two releases; however, it became a mainstream hit and made them one of the most popular hip hop groups in Korea. The album was a chart success with the title track, \"Fly\", reaching number one on domestic charts. \"Fly\" also featured on the soundtracks for FIFA 07 and Pump It Up . Another of the album tracks, \"Paris\" featuring Loveholics ' Jisun, was also a hit in Japan and Korea. The album was repackaged the following year as Black Swan Songs , which included remixes of several tracks. Originally set for release in October 2006, Epik High's fourth album Remapping the Human Soul was released on January 23, 2007. The two upbeat lead singles, \"Fan\" and \"Love Love Love\", were hits, while the rest of the album was darker and tackled diverse themes including sexual crime, war, religion, and education. The album was reportedly censored by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism as a result of its lyrical and thematic content. Despite this, it was a commercial success in both Korea and Japan. It went on to sell 120,301 copies during the year, making it the third best-selling album of 2007 in South Korea. During this time, the group spoke of their \"no genre, just music\" philosophy, expressing frustration with \"narrow\", \"out-dated and isolated\" perceptions of the hip hop genre. Over 50,000 copies of their fifth studio album entitled Pieces, Part One were pre-ordered before its release in April 2008. The album's release was followed by music videos for the singles \"One\", \"Breakdown\", and \"Umbrella\". After the album's success, Epik High released the EP Lovescream to acclaim in October, with the EP's title track \"1 Minute 1 Second\" topping online music charts. In early 2009, Epik High parted ways with Woollim Entertainment and founded Map The Soul, an independent record label that consisted of Epik High, MYK , Planet Shiver and Dok2 . They released their seventh work, a \"book album\" entitled \u9b42: Map the Soul , on March 27 and distributed it exclusively on Epik High's website.

Epik High's sixth album, [e] , was released on September 16 with the title single \"Wannabe (\ub530\ub77c\ud574)\" featuring Mellow, an electronic pop track critiquing K-pop trends. The studio album contained 30 tracks in a 2-CD format. Its release was followed by a South Korean tour, beginning on September 19. On October 15, 2009, DJ Tukutz enlisted for two years in mandatory military service , two days after his marriage. He was discharged in August 2011. While DJ Tukutz was conscribed, Epik High's seventh studio album Epilogue was released under Woollim Entertainment on March 9, 2010 to chart success. The music video for its title track, \"Run\", featured several members of the Woollim-signed boy band Infinite prior to their debut: L as the video's protagonist, Sunggyu as guitarist, Woohyun as bassist, and Sungjong as keyboardist. Infinite's Hoya and Dongwoo also served as backup dancers during promotions of the single on various music shows. Shortly after the album's release, Mithra Jin also entered into mandatory military service and served two years between August 3, 2010 \u2013 May 14, 2012. He entered the 102 reserve in Chuncheon and served as an infantry rifle soldier, a member of the military band, and a GOP soldier before settling at the Defense Media Agency (DEMA). During the two-year hiatus that followed, Tablo (who is a Canadian citizen and therefore was not required to carry out military service) signed a four-year contract with YG Entertainment and released a solo album titled Fever's End on November 1, 2011.

Christina Chu left the official line up due to her work in Canada , and Horan stepped in to fill her spot. Chu occasionally contributes her vocals to the band, although she is often an uncredited guest artist. Clazziquai released their first studio album, Instant Pig , in May 2004. The album received critical acclaim, which led to more than five songs from the album being used in six television commercials. The remixed English version of the song, \"Come To Me\", in its remix album Zbam was released in November 2004, and was later used as a song in a television commercial featuring David Beckham . Fantastic Plastic Machine praised Clazziquai as a new band to lead the \" Hallyu \". In 2005, Clazziquai's \"Be My Love\" and \"She Is\", were featured in the South Korean hit television drama, My Lovely Samsoon . These two major theme songs also raised the ratings of the series up 50%. Clazziquai had hoped then that people's imagination towards their music would not 'decrease as a result of their unexpected popularity'. In September 2005, Clazziquai released their second album, Color Your Soul claiming it had a \"raw, funkier feel presenting a combination of electronic music and [an] emphasized acoustic genre\". A remix album entitled Pinch Your Soul was released early the following year. In June 2007, Clazziquai's third album, Love Child of the Century , was released. A remix album, Robotica , was released later in the year. After the album's release, the members of Clazziquai grew busy with their own work, which started false rumors that Clazziquai could be disbanding. In 2008, a video game for the PlayStation Portable featuring many Clazziquai songs titled DJ Max Portable Clazziquai Edition was released. These songs were later released as part of the special album Metrotronics . In July 2009, Clazziquai released their fourth album, Mucho Punk , featuring the single \"Wizard of OZ\" which had been featured in an LG commercial that year. In concordance to Mucho Punk , Clazziquai released Japanese album, Mucho Musica , and later released a remix album, Mucho Mix . The remix version of the original album was released in South Korea later in the year as Mucho Beat . In December 2012, Clazziquai released the single, \"Can't Go On My Own\", as part of the Can We Get Married? OST. In February 2013, the band released their fifth album, Blessed , making it into the top ten of Gaon 's weekly album chart. They later held three 'Be Blessed' concerts throughout May and June. In September 2014, Clazziquai released their sixth album, Blink . They held a concert shortly after the release to celebrate their tenth anniversary as a band. In mid 2015, they held a concert at the Understage in Seoul. In September 2016, Clazziquai released their seventh album, Travellers . After the album's release the band held a concert at the Blue Square in Seoul. On September 10, 2019, the band released a brand new single, called What If . The song does not feature Horan, having new artist Kim Soo-young singing instead. In the accompanying press release, it was mentioned that Clazziquai will continue the collaboration project with various singers starting with the respective single and an EP is planned for a 2020 release. At the moment, it is uncertain whether Horan shall resume activities with the group or not. "}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewelry_(band)", "name": "Jewelry (group)", "labels": ["Star Empire", "Giza Studio"], "intro": "Jewelry ( Korean : \uc96c\uc5bc\ub9ac ) was a South Korean girl group formed in 2001 by Star Empire Entertainment . The group was the longest-running Korean girl group (with more than 2 members) until their disbandment in 2015, surpassing super-group Baby V.O.X. Jewelry founding members Park Jung-ah , Lee Ji-hyun , Jun Eun-mi and Jung Yoo-jin debuted in 2001 with their first album Discovery . After less-than-stellar sales of the first album, two of the singers (Jun Eun-mi and Jung Yoo-jin) were replaced by Seo In-young and Cho Min-ah. A year later, their second album, Again , was released, with much better results. Full of strong R&B ballads (as opposed to the sexy dance songs that were popular at that time), the album quickly yielded two high-charting singles \u2014 \"Again\" and \"Tonight\" \u2014 which started the group's rise to popularity. This was quickly followed by their third album Beloved , which had a very cutesy theme. Their first single \"\ub2c8\uac00 \ucc38 \uc88b\uc544\" (\"I Really Like You\") was very poppy and had Jewelry adopt a cutesy concept to match the song, with colorful outfits and perky dances. The title track, Be My Love , was also promoted. Even though album sales for Again and Beloved were great, the group was unhappy with their current image, and did not want to be known for only their cute and innocent songs. After the success of their second album, Jewelry left for Japan to start on their career there in 2004 with their first single Kokoro ga Tomaranai under the independent label Giza Studio . After releasing a few materials there with mediocre sales, the group eventually left to return to their native country to release their fourth album. By the time their fourth album Superstar came out in the beginning of 2005, Jewelry has since shed their \"cute image\" concept. Following the trend in Korean pop , they became sexier and more womanly, which helped bring about their current level of success. The first single \"Superstar\" (written by Shinhwa member Lee Min-woo ) was a driven rock song and surprisingly became a huge hit. They followed this up with the sexy R&B number \"Passion\", which also charted strongly. Both of these singles prominently featured \"sexy\" member Seo In-Young dance scantily-clad in short shorts, which brought the group much press attention (both positive and negative). In 2006, Jewelry took a break from the Korean music industry in order to focus on Japan. During that time, member Ji-hyun left to pursue an acting career. In early November, news leaked out that another member, Cho Min-ah , had also left, which forced their record company to look for a second replacement member. As Park Jung-Ah and Seo In-young had solo projects, a new album was not expected until mid-2007. In early 2008, Jewelry returned to the music scene with their new members Baby J and Eunjung with the release of their fifth album, Kitchi Island . Released on February 20, 2008, the album featured the single \"One More Time\", a cover of In-Grid 's song, composed by Sannie Carlson ( Whigfield ). \"One More Time\" has mirrored the success of Jewelry's 2005 hit single, \"Superstar\" in South Korea, reaching the No. 1 spot on MBC's Music Core and KBS's Music Bank , two weeks after the song's debut. The single has also achieved success online, topping the charts of various music websites, including Melon, Dosirak, Bugs Music, M.Net.com, Muz and Juke On. \"One More Time\" became the most successful single of Jewelry to date, staying on the no.1 spot for 7 weeks in a row on MBC's Music Core and KBS's Music Bank . In spring of 2008, a second single, \"\ubaa8\ub450 \ub2e4 \uc27f\" (\" Everybody Shh! \"), was released and promoted. The group was awarded with a Daesang (\ub300\uc0c1, a \"Top Award\"), for highest digital sales in 2008. In early 2009, members Baby J and Eunjung returned to the Korean music market, under the name \"Jewelry S\", debuting as a sub-group. Their mini-album, Sweet Song was released in digital format on January 22, and the full single was made available on February 6. Baby J and Eunjung made their live comeback on M. Countdown on February 5, where they sang \"\ub4e4\uc5b4\ubd10\" ( \"Listen\" ) and the lead single from their mini-album, \"\ub370\uc774\ud2b8\" ( \"Date\" ). The music video for \"Date\" features cameo appearances from Jewelry members Park Jung-ah and Seo In-young. Jewelry released a new single in June 2009 titled \"Super Star\" with the song \"Rally\" featuring rapper Nassun. The song was for MNet's talent competition, Superstar K . A music video was also released and featured the group's performance of the song on Mnet's M! Countdown as well as scenes of Superstar K. About a week prior to the album release, the song \"Strong Girl\" was released as a digital single. Their 6th album, Sophisticated , was released on August 27 with the music video for the title track, \"Vari2ty\", being released on the same day. In December 2009 Seo In-young and Park Jung-ah announced their departure. Korean media reported that Superstar K top 10 contender Semi was likely to replace them. A repackaged edition of their 6th album, End And.. was released on December 17, 2009 with the single \"Love Story\". On June 14, 2010, it was announced Semi would be joining Jewelry with a comeback happening later during the year. A few months later it was announced the groups comeback would occur in 2011. On January 18, 2011, Kim Ye-won joined Jewelry. A digital single, \"Back It Up\" was released on January 27 along with its accompanying music video. They made their comeback performance during the same day on M! Countdown . The single reached a certain amount of success however it was not as successful as their previous works. On May 9, Jewelry's label, Star Empire Entertainment, shared some old videos of Jewelry rehearsing various songs. Two days later they announced with teaser photos the group would release a new single which was later revealed to be \"Pass\". The single was released on May 16 along with a teaser MV featuring label mate Hwang Kwang Hee of ZE:A . No music video was released for \"Pass\". On September, Semi and Yewon joined the sub-unit Jewelry S and announced they would release a single entitled \"Ames Room Vol.2\", the title track being the song \"Forget It\". The single was released on September 20, and the music video was released the same day. Yewon joined the hit variety show Invincible Youth 2 to represent her group. The show started on November 17, 2011 and ended on November 12, 2012. In 2012, Jewelry was originally scheduled to make a comeback in July. However, this was delayed until October. On September 21, Jewelry announced their comeback with their first mini album \"Look At Me\", with the title track as the same name. The mini album was released on October 11. \"Look At Me\" debuted at #42 on the Gaon Digital Charts and later peaked at #23. The mini album also debuted at #7 on the Gaon National Physical Album Charts. The music video was also released during the same day and the group had their comeback performance on Music Bank the next day. During mid November, Jewelry was announced to release a digital single around early December. But towards the end of November, Star Empire Entertainment, announced the digital single was postponed and the group would spend more time preparing for their next release. In 2013, Star Empire announced that Jewelry will release a digital single in July called \"Hot & Cold\". On March 3, 2014, it was revealed that Eunjung's contract had expired and she would be leaving the group. Yewon was cast in the weekend drama Hotel King , in the role of an enthusiastic front desk officer. On April 17, 2014, Yewon hosted the Mnet talk show M Countdown Begins with K.Will . Meanwhile, Semi starred in a new sitcom, Boarding House no 24 as Park Semi. On November 19, 2014, Baby J revealed that she will be leaving Jewelry as her contract expired last August. It was also revealed that Semi would not be renewing her contract after it expired that month. On January 7, 2015, the group was officially confirmed as disbanded. On April 8, 2018, members Baby J, Eunjung, Inyoung and Jungah reunited on the JTBC 's show Sugarman 2 , where they performed their 2008 single One More Time . "}
{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra_(band)", "name": "Chakra (group)", "labels": ["Cream Records", "Zam Entertainment", "Kiss Entertainment"], "intro": "Chakra ( Korean : \uc0e4\ud06c\ub77c ) was a South Korean girl group that debuted in 2000 with four members: Hwangbo , Eun, Ryeowon , and Eani. Following the release of their first album, the group won Best New Artist at several major South Korean music awards. After Eani left the group in 2001, the group introduced new member Bona in 2002. Chakra ultimately released three more albums and disbanded in 2006. Chakra officially debuted on February 26, 2000 at Music Camp with their first single Han , immediately calling attention, due to its Indian music concept. In March of the year the group released their first solo album titled \"Come A Come\" with singles titled Come A Come , Hey You and Sign of Love . The album was a success and sold +162,251 copies that led them to win many rookie awards in South Korea, including the SBS Music Awards, the Golden Disk Awards and the Mnet Asian Music Awards. That same year, Chakra released their special Christmas album entitled \"Ringing Jingle Bells\" with the main ballad single \"Lonely Christmas\". In 2001, the group reached its peak when they released their second album \"Chakra'Ca\", along with the main single \"End\". It became their first #1 album in South Korea. The main theme focused on African music as the main concept of the album. The album sold +86,635 copies and won in the category of Best Singer dressed at the SBS Music Awards. The other success of this album was \"Oh My Boy\". At the time it was already very difficult to finance the group, due to a scam that happened to a new company called \"Kiss Entertainment\". In this process, Eani decided to leave the group at the end of 2001. They introduced a new member, Bona, in 2002. In 2002 they released their third album \"Chakra\" with the lead single \"Come Back\". In 2003, they released their last album, \"Tomato\" along with the first single From Me To You, which was a success. The album sold 23,450 copies and at the end of the year, Chakra won again in the Best Dance category at the SBS Music Awards, from this album there are other famous songs like \"True Love In This World Is A Live\" and the ballad \"Why Im The Only One\". After the end of the promotions of the last album in 2004, Ryeo-won left Chakra to continue her career as an actress. In 2005, it was planned to release a new album and do new activities, but the album could not be released due to the company's financial difficulties. Chakra members also suffered a lot of difficulties at this time, and the audience was almost indifferent to the actions of this Chakra triad; this caused Eun to leave the group. At the time, only HwangBo and Bona remained as members of Chakra. In 2006, Chakra disbanded.\n"}

{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CB_Mass", "name": "CB Mass", "labels": ["Daeyoung AV"], "intro": "CB Mass (Korean: CB \ub9e4\uc2a4) was a Korean hip hop group composed of members Choiza , Gaeko , and Curbin. They debuted in 2000 with the album Massmediah . The group disbanded in 2003. Choiza and Gaeko originally met in the sixth grade but before forming CB Mass they began an underground hip hop group named kod along with Sixpoint and ZASON, who joined in 1998. In the same year, Choiza and Gaeko met a fellow rapper Curbin and created CB Mass. The group debuted in 2000 under Drunken Tiger 's wing and released Massmediah to moderate success. In total they produced three albums: MassMediah in 2000, Massmatics in 2001, and Massappeal in 2003. They disbanded later the same year after a heated and public dispute where Curbin was accused of stealing money from the group. Their second album Massmatics was their most popular, with 120,000 copies sold in Korea. At the height of their success however there were continuous rumours that they would break up and their last album added weight to this speculation with just Gaeko and Choiza appearing on most of the songs. In the first song of Dynamic Duo's first album Gaeko raps \"He liked standing in front of mirrors than music/ He worshipped cash more than friendship/ What he left with us is only betrayal,\" in a barely concealed reference to Curbin. After CB Mass broke up, Gaeko and Choiza formed Dynamic Duo while Curbin announced plans to go solo but has not yet released any material. Like many hip hop groups CB Mass collaborated with many other Hip Hop groups and individuals. In the song Jinja (\uc9c4\uc9dc, meaning \"real\") they use the sample of Cheryl Lynn 's disco classic Got to be Real for the instrumental. In this music video it features cameo appearances from members of The Movement, an alliance of Korean rappers, which was founded by Drunken Tiger, CB MASS, Uptown and Thanos.
