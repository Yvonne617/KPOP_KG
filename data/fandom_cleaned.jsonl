She is a member of the girl group . Alongside , she joined in April, 2012. Hyelin had wanted to be a singer from a young age, she was so passionate about this dream that once when her father implied she couldn't do it, she didn't speak to him for months after. She joined in 2011 but failed to advance. After audition and training with EXID's original company, she\u00a0was going to be a member of the original lineup of EXID but was cut from the lineup before debut. However after three members left, she was added to the lineup (for her vocals and dancing) alongside former vocal coach to create the five-member group known since then. In 2016, EXID promoted their first full album . It was on this album that the long awaited duo of Hyelin and Jeonghwa would come with the song \"Are You Hungry?\".\u00a0Other than this bright and quirky track, Hyelin only participated in group tracks for this album. Due to Solji's thyroid condition, Hyelin had to take over main vocalist responsibilities in EXID's songs and performances. Because she was the only member with enough skill in her upper range to stand in for Solji, she had to sing Solji's parts in their older songs. She also had to take over all adlibs of new songs. EXID's first promotions without Solji began with the title track \"Night Rather Than Day\" from their third mini album where the music is more chill and less exciting than their normal music. EXID came back with \"DDD\" and the mini album in November of the same year and with that album came a solo track for Hyelin which she participated in writing for. The solo track was called \"Foolish\" and was Hyelin's first solo work since joining EXID. EXID first promoted in 2018 in April with the single album \" \". This song and it's promotions caused Hyelin's popularity to rise more than ever before as she sings the highest note to be in an EXID song on it, and because of her newly long and straight black hair. Her dance skills were also shown off much more in this comeback than previous comebacks, as legs and footwork\u00a0were more emphasized and this is something Hyelin is much more comfortable with and good at than their normal sexy style of dancing that emphasizes their hips. On January 15, 2020, a Banana Culture source confirmed to local news outlet that Hyelin's contract with the company had come to an end and she decided not to renew it.
