# Korean Pop Knowledge Graph
Team members: Qiuke Wang, Xiaoyue Chen

### 1.Introduction
K-pop has become a truly global phenomenon thanks to its distinctive blend of addictive melodies, slick choreography, production values, and an endless parade of attractive South Korean performers who spend years in grueling studio systems learning to sing and dance in synchronized perfection. The K-pop Wiki is a knowledge graph project that captured the information about the Korean Pop music groups. Users can get all the detailed information about the K-pop groups and discover groups that they may like through our project. Besides, users can predict whether a pre-debut group will be popular or not in the near future by using the model we built.
