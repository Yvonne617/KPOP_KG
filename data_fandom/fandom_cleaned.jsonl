They released their first pre-debut digital single, \"MIDNIGHT Project Single Album Vol.1\", on March 9, 2019. In September 2018, H&I Entertainment posted an audition notice on OTR looking for members of their upcoming girl group, which would debut either in the last half of 2018 or the first half of 2019. In November, they revealed the first three members of MIDNIGHT to be Danbi, Dami, and Byeoljji on their Instagram. In January 2019, it was announced through audition pages and the group's YouTube descriptions that MIDNIGHT would debut in April with five/six members. By this time, Dami had left the group and Danbi and Byeoljji had stayed. The same month, they introduced two new members, Serin and Yebin, through dance covers. A month later, in February, Jiwon was introduced through the '2018 BEST solo singer medley' dance cover posted on their YouTube channel. At this point, people started believing Serin had left the group due to the group account unfollowing her on Instagram and her not being a part of the cover videos they released previously. (Her stage name would later be stylized as J.won) The same month, another Jiwon, who went by the stage name Yudi, introduced herself as a member of MIDNIGHT on her personal Instagram. She was officially introduced on March 2, a couple of days before the release of their first single. As the other three members, she was also introduced through a dance cover. On March 9, the first part of the 'Girl Group's Flooded' project was released. What the project was about, was only explained in April, after the release of the second part of the project \"Swish\", in . They explained they would release a song every month until they would formally debut to express the members' various colors and charms. On April 8 and 9, H&I introduced two new trainees, Seyeon and Seungeun, as members of MIDNIGHT to replace Yudi, Jiwon, and Yebin, who had left the group in between releases. On April 19, MIDNIGHT uploaded a cover video by a new member: Cherry (but at the time using her birthname Yujeong). She was, however, never formally introduced as a member, and seems to have left the group after just a couple of days. An April debut fell through at the last moment as they had been posting about it until March 2. On June 5, revealed MIDNIGHT's debut was impending. Five days later, MIDNIGHT introduced Chaewon through an Instagram post as a new member, making MIDNIGHT a five-member girl group again. On July 23, a new member was introduced through a vocal cover of \"Be Be Your Love\" by Rachael Yamagata: Twitch streamer, actress, model, and singer Yunu. Three weeks later, on August 14, MIDNIGHT released a music teaser for their third pre-debut single. The teaser did not include Yunu and whether she is going to make an appearance in the music video the same style Yudi did, at the end of the music video, is not known right now. The group, however, had already finished shooting their music video before Yunu's introduction. On September 17, MIDNIGHT revealed they were working on their debut album while simultaneously working on their final project song, which they aim to release in December 2019. They have yet to decide whether this last pre-debut song will be put in a mini-album along with the other pre-debut songs, or if it will be a stand-alone single like the other three. On the same day, it became clear the rumors of Chaewon having left the group had been true. The article talking about MIDNIGHT's final project song introduced the group as a five-member girl group, did not Chaewon as a member and used a picture of MIDNIGHT's line-up excluding Chaewon. Not long after, Seyeon also left the group without any notice being given. Around the end of September/the beginning of October, MIDNIGHT started following a new girl on Instagram: Ha Yera. In the bio of her personal Instagram account, she revealed herself as a member of MIDNIGHT. But within a couple of days, she seems to have left the group again. She deleted the message asking for her followers to love her and MIDNIGHT, she unfollowed all the members and the group (and vice versa), and she removed MIDNIGHT from her bio. On October 22, an audition page for new members for MIDNIGHT was published on OTR. On the page, it was revealed that MIDNIGHT was aiming to debut in the early half of 2020.

I LUV made their first public during a talent showcase they held alongside at Wanna Be training center. At the time, I LUV consisted of the four members Seoyoon, Erika, Seoha and an unknown former member. The latter was never seen or heard from again after the showcase. I LUV promoted as three-member girl group until Erika left the team. No official announcement was made on her departure, but she was replaced by Juhwi and Chinese member Chloe (who would change her stage name to Mia in 2019 since her Korean was Kim Mia). In December 2018, WKS ENE revealed they were planning to make I LUV an eight-member girl group. They were going to do this through line-up systems. They would first introduce the six-member version of I LUV before they would finish up with the eight-member line-up. The final line-up was supposed to consist of four Korean and four Chinese members. For the six-member version, they were going to introduce Chinese member Saki and a Korean maknae. On the 29th of December, Gahyeon was revealed, but Saki never made an appearance. At the beginning of 2019, WKS ENE let go of the eight-member Korean-Chinese girl group idea and planned to make I LUV a six-member group. They added Rina to the line-up and announced they were going to start promoting their debut in March. On February 10, the company announced Seoha, Juhwi, and Rina had left the group due to injuries. They stated they would replace the members that had left and that fans could look forward to the new six-member version of I LUV. They started introducing the new members, Dahyun, Cui Xiang and Mari, one by one. However, in between reveals, Chloe had either left the group or had been scrapped. There has been no official statement on her departure from the group. After having delayed their debut a couple of times, I LUV debuted on April 30 with \" \". The music video was released three days later. In August, WKS announced the \"Dream and Challenge\" project. Through this project, the company would choose members for I LUV to make and promote their second album since debut. To make it a fair competition, every member from their debut line-up could be eliminated and replaced by one of WKS' trainees. In the end, three of the members from their debut line-up stayed (Seo Yoon, Ga Hyun, and Cui Xiang), and three trainees were added to the line-up (Min Ah, Ji Won, and Ji Ho). Ma Ri and Da Hyun were eliminated. Sometime later, they also added Soo Yeon to the group. She did not shoot the music video for \"Open The Door\" with the rest of the group, but she was present during their performances. On December 5, WKS announced the group will begin cable broadcast activities in December and perform on music shows in mid-January.
